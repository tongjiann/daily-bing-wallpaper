Each of us have our own traditions, from filling stockings to hosting parties and playing festive music. Today's snapshot portrays the annual celebration in the Town Hall Square of Tartu, Estonia, which is illuminated with gleaming lights and adorned with a display of Christmas trees. Tartu's Christmas fair has a merry atmosphere, featuring sleigh rides, fire kettles and wooden animal carousels. All of this is accompanied by smoked meats, hot drinks and crispy gingerbread. Whether you're watching a classic holiday movie or cozying up with a cup of hot cocoa as the clock strikes twelve, let the Christmas spirit reign on this peaceful night—and don't forget the milk and cookies!","date":"Dec. 24, 2023","bsTitle":"How lovely are your branches","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231224_EstoniaXmasEve%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"19381f7390ffadffeaf3e1f0ee114626","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EstoniaXmasEve_EN-CA2639551026_tmb.jpg","title":"Christmas Eve","desc":"There's a certain magic in knowing that in towns around the world, shops are closing, streets are emptying and friends and families are…","hash":"ByAQbC4PaLiylgbh5eqwxq4u2CJo5vlIOF/H+hPlueo="}},{"startdate":"20231223","fullstartdate":"202312230500","enddate":"20231224","url":"/th?id=OHR.FestivusPenguins_EN-CA2075026889_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.FestivusPenguins_EN-CA2075026889","copyright":"Chinstrap penguins, South Sandwich Islands, South Atlantic Ocean (© Jan Vermeer/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Festivus&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220231223_0500%22","title":"They've got some things to say","caption":"Festivus","copyrightonly":"© Jan Vermeer/Minden Pictures","desc":"Sometimes when stuck with family around the holidays, it might be tempting to give them an earful, like this chinstrap penguin is doing here on the South Sandwich Islands.

The secular holiday was popularised in a 'Seinfeld' episode in the show's final season. The Costanza family has a collection of odd traditions, including putting up an aluminum Festivus pole—for its high weight-to-strength ratio—and airing their year-end personal grievances. Since the episode debuted, the holiday has taken on a life of its own both among fans and people looking for an alternative way to celebrate the season.

The park was named after a series of Navajo sandstone domes that were said to resemble the US Capitol Building, while the Waterpocket Fold was referred to as a reef since it obstructed smooth transportation. Known as 'a wrinkle in the Earth's crust,' the Waterpocket Fold was carved by eons of erosion. The 161-kilometre-long monocline—a step-like fold—was presumably formed around 50 to 70 million years ago and is home to towering cliffs, narrow canyons, and colourful rock formations.","date":"Dec. 18, 2023","bsTitle":"Snow, snow on the range","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231218_CapitolReefSnow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2c583f29cc7bc91fe8310e198ebfaf70","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CapitolReefSnow_EN-CA8234671064_tmb.jpg","title":"Capitol Reef National Park, Utah","desc":"Carved by time, wind, and water, Capitol Reef National Park showcases rust-hued cliffs and the natural beauty of the American West…","hash":"gSWjKjkxEYrhCM5VlurylDu4Y35LfJ1jmd70YsVdYkg="}},{"startdate":"20231217","fullstartdate":"202312170500","enddate":"20231218","url":"/th?id=OHR.WinterWaxwings_EN-CA5729740430_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.WinterWaxwings_EN-CA5729740430","copyright":"Bohemian waxwings perched on a branch, Canada (© Jim Cumming/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Bohemian+waxwings&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220231217_0500%22","title":"Feathered fashionistas","caption":"Bohemian waxwings","copyrightonly":"© Jim Cumming/Shutterstock","desc":"Among their feathered friends, Bohemian waxwings, clad in their elegant greyish-brown plumage, stand out as the wandering singers of the Northern Hemisphere.

If alarmed, they freeze with their bill and neck pointing upwards. In winter, they feast upon cotoneaster, juniper, and rowan berries—the latter is their favourite. As spring casts its spell, these nomads engage in nesting. The female waxwings craft the nests, laying 2 to 6 bluish-grey eggs. The hatchlings are fed a diet of insects and fruits by both parents.
