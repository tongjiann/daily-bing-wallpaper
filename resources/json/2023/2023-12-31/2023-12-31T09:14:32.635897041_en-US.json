With two layers of fur and eyes that adapt to the Arctic's shifting light levels, reindeer are very versatile. You likely won't see them fly, but you might find a herd migrating from tundra to forest in the North Polar Region, North America, Northern Europe, or Siberia. Their hooves can expand or shrink according to ground conditions, keeping their heavy frame stable on soft ground in summer, ice in winter, and steep rooftops at Christmas.
