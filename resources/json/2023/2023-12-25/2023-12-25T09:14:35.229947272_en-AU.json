President Franklin D. Roosevelt recognised the park's splendour by designating it as a national monument in 1937, and later it was elevated to a national park in 1971. The park was named after a series of Navajo sandstone domes that were said to resemble the US Capitol Building, while the Waterpocket Fold was referred to as a reef since it obstructed smooth transportation. Known as 'a wrinkle in the Earth's crust,' the Waterpocket Fold was carved by eons of erosion. The 161-kilometre-long monocline—a step-like fold—was presumably formed around 50 to 70 million years ago, and is home to towering cliffs, narrow canyons and colourful rock formations.","date":"18 Dec 2023","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231218_CapitolReefSnow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2238a3f2a71869eb5ed8d744d082728f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CapitolReefSnow_ROW5391162531_tmb.jpg","title":"Capitol Reef National Park, Utah, USA","desc":"Carved by time, wind and water, Capitol Reef National Park showcases rust-hued cliffs and the natural beauty of the American West.

Their striking appearance comes from the contrast between their velvety grey body and the vibrant, waxy red tips gracing their secondary wing feathers. If alarmed, they freeze with their bill and neck pointing upwards. In winter they feast upon cotoneaster, juniper and rowan berries—the latter is their favourite. As spring casts its spell, these nomads engage in nesting. The female waxwings craft the nests, laying 2 to 6 bluish-grey eggs. The hatchlings are fed a diet of insects and fruits by both parents. One can easily spot these sociable birds, as they often gather in chirpy flocks in North America and Eurasia.","date":"17 Dec 2023","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231217_WinterWaxwings%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e964286f14bd18e645143a83e388b28a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WinterWaxwings_ROW5231052812_tmb.jpg","title":"Bohemian waxwings","desc":"Among their feathered friends, Bohemian waxwings, clad in their elegant greyish-brown plumage, stand out as the wandering singers of the…","hash":"Qm44g/chB2aQtUM9g1JpDiRwzTNH9oZGi14WvUch5Tk="}},{"startdate":"20231216","fullstartdate":"202312160800","enddate":"20231217","url":"/th?id=OHR.GrandPlaceXmas_ROW6848615131_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.GrandPlaceXmas_ROW6848615131","copyright":"Guild houses of Grand-Place, Brussels, Belgium (© Richard Taylor/Sime/eStock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Grand+Place+Belgium&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220231216_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Guild houses of Grand-Place, Brussels, Belgium","copyrightonly":"© Richard Taylor/Sime/eStock Photo","desc":"Located in the heart of Belgium, Brussels is a vibrant capital city that combines rich history with a modern, cosmopolitan feel.
