The seal moms feed their pups on the beach for three weeks and their effort is noticeable. The offspring gain approximately 2 kilograms each day in those weeks! Following the feeding period, the young seals are not water-ready just yet. They stay on the beach until their pale fur darkens to a mottled grey, then head to the sea and learn to hunt themselves.","date":"21 Nov 2023","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231121_HelloSeal%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b51de8b395e0d407ede9d7d5cbcb00a0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HelloSeal_ROW8488549589_tmb.jpg","title":"Grey seal pup","desc":"If you happen to visit England's Norfolk coasts around this time, you're very likely to see some grey seal pups experiencing the world for…","hash":"/O0XDZ/v6SB8L1sV1J1RAi/8vs0rbfb/A8NQMEtuStk="}},{"startdate":"20231120","fullstartdate":"202311200800","enddate":"20231121","url":"/th?id=OHR.CastleCoch_ROW8419231737_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.CastleCoch_ROW8419231737","copyright":"Castell Coch, Tongwynlais, South Wales (© Billy Stock/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Castell+Coch&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220231120_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Castell Coch, Tongwynlais, South Wales","copyrightonly":"© Billy Stock/Alamy","desc":"Castell Coch, Welsh for 'Red Castle', is perched on a wooded hill in Cardiff, Wales.

Its external features and high Victorian interiors stand as an example of the brilliance of its designer. Melding together remnants of the mediaeval fortress with 19th-century innovations, its design achieves a synthesis that is hailed as a highlight of the Gothic Revival in Britain. The surrounding beech forest contributes to the fairytale-like background, and it contains geological features of limestone, sandstone and rare plant species such as the butterfly orchid, bird's-nest orchid and dog's mercury.
