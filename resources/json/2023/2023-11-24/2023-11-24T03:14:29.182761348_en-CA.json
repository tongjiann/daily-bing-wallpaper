If you don't plan on travelling to the UK, you can still embark on an adventure to Sable Island, home to the world's largest colony of grey seals. There are five species of seals commonly found here: harp seals, ringed seals, grey seals, hooded seals, and bearded seals. The breeding season for seals varies depending on the species. Once grey seal pups are born, they nurse for several weeks before they are able to swim and hunt on their own.
