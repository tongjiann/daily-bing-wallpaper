The city is one of the world's oldest, with a recorded history going back over 3,400 years. Its blend of ancient monuments and modern society make it a truly unique destination.","date":"16 Nov 2023","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231116_AthensAcropolis%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"474e85577fb75f6e4db2ba970048975a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AthensAcropolis_ROW7438895152_tmb.jpg","title":"Athens and the Acropolis, Greece","desc":"Let's talk about Athens, the capital of Greece.
