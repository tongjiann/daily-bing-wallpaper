The term Minnewanka comes from their name for it, 'Minn-waki' or 'Lake of the Spirits.' As tourism began to develop in the Canadian Rockies, a settlement was built on the lakeshore. However, the lake was dammed once in 1895 and again in 1912 to reserve water for a hydroelectric plant downstream. The Minnewanka Landing settlement disappeared under the higher waters and now can only be accessed by scuba divers. Today, this glacial lake is the second-largest in Banff National Park, at a length of approximately 21 kilometres.","date":"Dec. 1, 2023","bsTitle":"Starlight, shining bright","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231201_MinnewankaLake%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f002e4f4de4404bab1b7b00b50d4dbfd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MinnewankaLake_EN-CA2495233289_tmb.jpg","title":"Lake Minnewanka, Alberta","desc":"The sight of stars above Lake Minnewanka has been taken in by humans for centuries.

The celebration of St. Andrew's Day holds significant importance in Canada, particularly among those with Scottish roots. From Halifax to Vancouver, people from diverse backgrounds participate in the festivities.

Their vision was to make a difference by providing joy to everyone through acts of charity. Generosity is something we can all practice, and there are many ways to become involved, such as volunteering at a local non-profit organisation, shelter, or food bank, donating to a charity, or simply giving a voice to people in need in your community.
