Iconic Hollywood films such as 'Prometheus' and 'Snow White and the Huntsman' were shot at the Storr in Scotland.","date":"30 Nov 2023","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231130_TrotternishStorr%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"71cdd0922e6c2548a1f2450654f23404","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TrotternishStorr_ROW9568788023_tmb.jpg","title":"The Old Man of Storr, Isle of Skye, Scotland, UK","desc":"Scotland's often supernatural-seeming landscapes are suitable backgrounds for folklore and culture.

The former structure was built by the West Slavic Obodrite tribe, who inhabited what is today's Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Poland, particularly on the southern shores of the Baltic Sea. Later, in the 16th century, Duke Johann Albrecht I expanded it into a magnificent Renaissance residence. Finally, in the 19th century, the castle was rebuilt into what we see today. The architect Georg Adolf Demmler redesigned the building in the romantic neo-Gothic style. For centuries, the castle was the residence of the Grand Dukes of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and then became a center for art and culture with an impressive art collection. Today, you can visit the Mecklenburg State Museum and admire this magnificent castle from the inside.","date":"29 Nov 2023","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231129_SchwerinerSchloss%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3ef6e30f6f0dee44ed1011a52e4879a8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SchwerinerSchloss_ROW9723994138_tmb.jpg","title":"Schwerin Castle on Lake Schwerin, Germany","desc":"The Schwerin Castle, standing on an island in Lake Schwerin in Germany, looks like a floating mansion from a fairy tale.
