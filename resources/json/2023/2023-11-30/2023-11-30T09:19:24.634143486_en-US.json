Early English settlers had plenty to be thankful for, whether surviving the long voyage to America or the first harsh winters. Written records tell of an early thanksgiving shared between Plymouth Pilgrims and Wampanoag Native Americans, who provided a harvest of corn, deer, and turkey. There were many early days of thanksgiving, but an official, national celebration was proclaimed by George Washington in 1789, and has been a part of our holiday season ever since. Today, we wish you good company and plenty of things to be thankful for.

Bring your binoculars with you, and if it's summertime, be on the lookout for pronghorn, which travel about 150 miles to get there from Wyoming's Upper Green River Basin. They aren't the only creatures to visit seasonally; elk and bison are also summer visitors. These migrations play a vital role in the ecosystem of Grand Teton National Park. The animals help disperse seeds and are also food for predators.","date":"Nov 22, 2023","bsTitle":"The quiet beauty of Grand Teton","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231122_SnakeRiverTeton%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fda02c13cd77bf908a7eab483b8049fb","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SnakeRiverTeton_EN-US2749569171_tmb.jpg","title":"Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming","desc":"Today's image gives us a glimpse of beautiful Grand Teton National Park, in our least populous state, Wyoming.
