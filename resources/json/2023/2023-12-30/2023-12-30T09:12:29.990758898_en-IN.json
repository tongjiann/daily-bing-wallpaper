Chinstrap penguins are easily identifiable birds that inhabit the icy and rocky shores of Antarctica and its surrounding islands. Named for the distinctive thin black line that runs across their chin and under their heads, these medium-sized penguins stand out with their black and white plumage. These social birds are known for their lively and energetic behaviour, both on land and in the water. Agile swimmers, chinstrap penguins use their powerful flippers to navigate the frigid waters in search of their primary diet—small fish, krill, and other marine creatures. Adult chinstraps typically reach a height of about 68 to 76 centimetres and weigh between 3.2 to 5.3 kilograms.","date":"Dec 23, 2023","bsTitle":"They've got some things to say","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231222_FestivusPenguins%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"93390694e5824256c6bd7d95dc7213e0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FestivusPenguins_EN-IN5922835342_tmb.jpg","title":"Chinstrap penguins","desc":"Imagine you are in South Sandwich Islands, and you see this cute creature!

The park was named after a series of Navajo sandstone domes that were said to resemble the US Capitol Building, while the Waterpocket Fold was referred to as a reef since it obstructed smooth transportation. Known as 'a wrinkle in the Earth's crust,' the Waterpocket Fold was carved by eons of erosion.

If alarmed, they freeze with their bill and neck pointing upwards. In winter, they feast upon cotoneaster, juniper and rowan berries—the latter is their favourite. As spring casts its spell, these nomads engage in nesting. The female waxwings craft the nests, laying 2 to 6 bluish-grey eggs. The hatchlings are fed a diet of insects and fruits by both parents.
