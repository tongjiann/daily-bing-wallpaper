Its name, which means black river, comes from its dark appearance when viewed from a distance. As a result, the water can reflect the colourful hues of the sky overhead, such as the vibrant blue and partial rainbow seen here. The colour of the river comes from the high concentration of humic acid, thanks to decomposing organic matter that seeps from nearby swamps. As one of the largest northern-bank tributaries of the Amazon River, the Río Negro plays a crucial role in the complex Amazon basin ecosystem. The river is home to many plants and animals, including the critically endangered Brazilian barefaced tamarin, the giant river otter, and nearly 700 species of fish.","date":"Nov. 27, 2023","bsTitle":"Mirror, mirror, on the water","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231127_RioNegro%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d917e9f55890ec4373496c967b560408","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RioNegro_EN-CA4800560662_tmb.jpg","title":"Río Negro, Amazon basin, Brazil","desc":"The Río Negro, originating in Colombia, is one of dozens of tributaries that flow into the massive Amazon River.

There are five species of seals commonly found here: harp seals, ringed seals, grey seals, hooded seals, and bearded seals. The breeding season for seals varies depending on the species. Once grey seal pups are born, they nurse for several weeks before they are able to swim and hunt on their own.
