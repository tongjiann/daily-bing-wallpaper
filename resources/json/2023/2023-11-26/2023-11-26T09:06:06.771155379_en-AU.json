This occasionally ice-covered, vast area of wetlands, forests and rivers is the largest natural reserve in Estonia. From the majestic white-tailed eagle to the elusive black stork, over 200 bird species can be found here. Situated in the county of Tartu and covering an expanse of 341 square kilometres, this reserve hosts unspoiled wilderness. A tapestry of aquatic forests unfolds here: still water, bog and floodplain forests, dotted with elongated sedge plants. Winding trails and boardwalks here invite explorers to craft their own adventures.","date":"19 Nov 2023","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231119_FrozenBog%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ce0ee80483506aa8afc773525e2862ed","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FrozenBog_ROW8352024673_tmb.jpg","title":"Alam-Pedja Nature Reserve, Estonia","desc":"Among Estonia's array of natural sites is the Alam-Pedja Nature Reserve, established in 1994.

From October to November, these white giants pass through, waiting for the sea ice to form so they can head out to hunt seals. Scared? Tourists can safely view polar bears from the comfort of custom vehicles. A so-called 'polar bear jail' is also maintained to manage bear-human interactions.
