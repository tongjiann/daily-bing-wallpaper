Their vision was to make a difference by providing joy to everyone through acts of charity. Generosity is something we can all practice, and there are many ways to become involved, such as volunteering at a local non-profit organisation, shelter, or food bank, donating to a charity, or simply giving a voice to people in need in your community.

The colour of the river comes from the high concentration of humic acid, thanks to decomposing organic matter that seeps from nearby swamps. As one of the largest northern-bank tributaries of the Amazon River, the Río Negro plays a crucial role in the complex Amazon basin ecosystem.
