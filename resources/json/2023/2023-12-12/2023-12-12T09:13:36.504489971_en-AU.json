Later, in the 16th century, Duke Johann Albrecht I expanded it into a magnificent Renaissance residence. Finally, in the 19th century, the castle was rebuilt into what we see today. The architect Georg Adolf Demmler redesigned the building in the romantic neo-Gothic style. For centuries, the castle was the residence of the Grand Dukes of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and then became a center for art and culture with an impressive art collection.
