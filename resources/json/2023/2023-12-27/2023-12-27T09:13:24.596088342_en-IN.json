Wooden huts open their doors to visitors, and a nostalgic cable car ride, each cabin adorned with twinkling fairy lights, travels above the Christmas Village. During the 18th century, the valley became famous for its production of statuettes and intricately carved wooden figurines, which were initially crafted to decorate Catholic churches. Amongst those creations, the peg wooden doll emerged as one of Val Gardena's best-known products and is still being produced today.","date":"Dec 20, 2023","bsTitle":"Lights of the Dolomites","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231219_ValGardenaItaly%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"12d9e06d702263319e0f321a8229954d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ValGardenaItaly_EN-IN2770254332_tmb.jpg","title":"Val Gardena, South Tyrol, Dolomites, Italy","desc":"The Val Gardena valley in Northern Italy is renowned as a tourist destination for skiing, rock climbing and woodcarving enthusiasts.

The park was named after a series of Navajo sandstone domes that were said to resemble the US Capitol Building, while the Waterpocket Fold was referred to as a reef since it obstructed smooth transportation. Known as 'a wrinkle in the Earth's crust,' the Waterpocket Fold was carved by eons of erosion. The 161-kilometres-long monocline—a step-like fold—was presumably formed around 50 to 70 million years ago, and is home to towering cliffs, narrow canyons and colourful rock formations.","date":"Dec 18, 2023","bsTitle":"Snow, snow on the range","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231217_CapitolReefSnow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"cb7f33250407d3dbeb6cea5d4c880639","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CapitolReefSnow_EN-IN2337695579_tmb.jpg","title":"Capitol Reef National Park, Utah","desc":"Carved by time, wind and water, Capitol Reef National Park showcases rust-hued cliffs and the natural beauty of the American West.

If alarmed, they freeze with their bill and neck pointing upwards. In winter, they feast upon cotoneaster, juniper and rowan berries—the latter is their favourite. As spring casts its spell, these nomads engage in nesting. The female waxwings craft the nests, laying 2 to 6 bluish-grey eggs. The hatchlings are fed a diet of insects and fruits by both parents.
