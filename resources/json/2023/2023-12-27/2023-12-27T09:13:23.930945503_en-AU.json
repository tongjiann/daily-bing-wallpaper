Wooden huts open their doors to visitors, and a nostalgic cable car ride, each cabin adorned with twinkling fairy lights, travels above the village. During the 18th century, the valley became famous for its production of statuettes and intricately carved wooden figurines, which were initially crafted to decorate Catholic churches. Amongst those creations, the peg wooden doll emerged as one of Val Gardena's best-known products and is still being produced today.","date":"20 Dec 2023","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231220_ValGardenaItaly%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6552a24553d8101ecefe7131b95b338b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ValGardenaItaly_ROW5713359694_tmb.jpg","title":"Val Gardena, South Tyrol, Dolomites, Italy","desc":"The Val Gardena valley in Northern Italy is renowned as a tourist destination for skiing, rock climbing and woodcarving enthusiasts.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt recognised the park's splendour by designating it as a national monument in 1937, and later it was elevated to a national park in 1971. The park was named after a series of Navajo sandstone domes that were said to resemble the US Capitol Building, while the Waterpocket Fold was referred to as a reef since it obstructed smooth transportation. Known as 'a wrinkle in the Earth's crust,' the Waterpocket Fold was carved by eons of erosion. The 161-kilometre-long monocline—a step-like fold—was presumably formed around 50 to 70 million years ago, and is home to towering cliffs, narrow canyons and colourful rock formations.","date":"18 Dec 2023","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231218_CapitolReefSnow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2238a3f2a71869eb5ed8d744d082728f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CapitolReefSnow_ROW5391162531_tmb.jpg","title":"Capitol Reef National Park, Utah, USA","desc":"Carved by time, wind and water, Capitol Reef National Park showcases rust-hued cliffs and the natural beauty of the American West.

If alarmed, they freeze with their bill and neck pointing upwards. In winter they feast upon cotoneaster, juniper and rowan berries—the latter is their favourite. As spring casts its spell, these nomads engage in nesting. The female waxwings craft the nests, laying 2 to 6 bluish-grey eggs. The hatchlings are fed a diet of insects and fruits by both parents. One can easily spot these sociable birds, as they often gather in chirpy flocks in North America and Eurasia.","date":"17 Dec 2023","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231217_WinterWaxwings%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e964286f14bd18e645143a83e388b28a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WinterWaxwings_ROW5231052812_tmb.jpg","title":"Bohemian waxwings","desc":"Among their feathered friends, Bohemian waxwings, clad in their elegant greyish-brown plumage, stand out as the wandering singers of the…","hash":"Qm44g/chB2aQtUM9g1JpDiRwzTNH9oZGi14WvUch5Tk="}},{"startdate":"20231216","fullstartdate":"202312160800","enddate":"20231217","url":"/th?id=OHR.GrandPlaceXmas_ROW6848615131_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.GrandPlaceXmas_ROW6848615131","copyright":"Guild houses of Grand-Place, Brussels, Belgium (© Richard Taylor/Sime/eStock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Grand+Place+Belgium&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220231216_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Guild houses of Grand-Place, Brussels, Belgium","copyrightonly":"© Richard Taylor/Sime/eStock Photo","desc":"Located in the heart of Belgium, Brussels is a vibrant capital city that combines rich history with a modern, cosmopolitan feel.
