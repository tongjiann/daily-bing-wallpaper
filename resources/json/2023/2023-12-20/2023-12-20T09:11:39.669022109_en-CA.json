Beyond fishing, it also serves as a sanctuary for travellers looking for a peaceful getaway, with as many as 200,000 visitors in a single year. The traditional rorbu houses, built on poles over water, add a distinctive layer of charm to the town. These cabins were once made for travelling fishermen and have now been refurbished to meet contemporary tastes.","date":"Dec. 13, 2023","bsTitle":"Life in a hut-shell","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231213_LofotenRorbu%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2c86354b826314968742f61b4b7f5efc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LofotenRorbu_EN-CA0505973846_tmb.jpg","title":"Svolvaer, Lofoten Islands, Norway","desc":"Housed in the Arctic Circle, Norway's Lofoten Islands are a crossroads of traditional life and modern industry.
