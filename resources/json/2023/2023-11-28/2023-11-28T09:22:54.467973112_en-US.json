They stay on the beach until they shed their pale fur to make way for a waterproof, mottled gray coat. Then it's time to head to the sea and learn to hunt for themselves.","date":"Nov 21, 2023","bsTitle":"Welcome to the world, pup!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231121_HelloSeal%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"bb9fd844a7ebd5bafde91490078b341f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HelloSeal_EN-US2666982656_tmb.jpg","title":"Gray seal pup, Norfolk, England","desc":"Here in Norfolk, on the east coast of England, a seasonal wildlife spectacle is underway.
