About 3,000 grey seal babies are born on the shoreline between early November and January each year, making the area one of the most significant breeding regions in the United Kingdom. If you don't plan on travelling to the UK, you can still embark on an adventure to Sable Island, home to the world's largest colony of grey seals. There are five species of seals commonly found here: harp seals, ringed seals, grey seals, hooded seals, and bearded seals. The breeding season for seals varies depending on the species. Once grey seal pups are born, they nurse for several weeks before they are able to swim and hunt on their own. With their undeniable charm and ecological importance, seals are woven into the tapestry of Canada's wilderness.","date":"Nov. 21, 2023","bsTitle":"Welcome to the world, pup!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231121_HelloSeal%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1b51a3b77cc51d172b1d498d2de92833","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HelloSeal_EN-CA8920941536_tmb.jpg","title":"Grey seal pup","desc":"If you happen to visit England's Norfolk coasts around this season, you're very likely to see some grey seal pups experiencing the world for…","hash":"pH3hvTi1DqHPJR8FK5ApFVD2Av5bw9SjmmhwrsdGhCA="}},{"startdate":"20231120","fullstartdate":"202311200500","enddate":"20231121","url":"/th?id=OHR.ChapmanAdventure_EN-CA7617553421_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ChapmanAdventure_EN-CA7617553421","copyright":"Chapman Adventure Playground in the Gathering Place, Tulsa, Oklahoma (© Susan Vineyard/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=World+Children%27s+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220231120_0500%22","title":"Every day is a play day!","caption":"World Children's Day","copyrightonly":"© Susan Vineyard/Alamy","desc":"Children are the future, brimming with potential, curiosity, and dreams waiting to be fulfilled.
