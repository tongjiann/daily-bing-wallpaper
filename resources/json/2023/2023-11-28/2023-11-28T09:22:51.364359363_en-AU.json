About 3,000 grey seal babies are born on the shoreline between early November and January each year—slightly earlier than the ones living on the US coasts—making the area one of the most significant breeding regions in the United Kingdom. The seal moms feed their pups on the beach for three weeks and their effort is noticeable. The offspring gain approximately 2 kilograms each day in those weeks! Following the feeding period, the young seals are not water-ready just yet. They stay on the beach until their pale fur darkens to a mottled grey, then head to the sea and learn to hunt themselves.","date":"21 Nov 2023","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231121_HelloSeal%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b51de8b395e0d407ede9d7d5cbcb00a0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HelloSeal_ROW8488549589_tmb.jpg","title":"Grey seal pup","desc":"If you happen to visit England's Norfolk coasts around this time, you're very likely to see some grey seal pups experiencing the world for…","hash":"/O0XDZ/v6SB8L1sV1J1RAi/8vs0rbfb/A8NQMEtuStk="}},{"startdate":"20231120","fullstartdate":"202311200800","enddate":"20231121","url":"/th?id=OHR.CastleCoch_ROW8419231737_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.CastleCoch_ROW8419231737","copyright":"Castell Coch, Tongwynlais, South Wales (© Billy Stock/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Castell+Coch&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220231120_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Castell Coch, Tongwynlais, South Wales","copyrightonly":"© Billy Stock/Alamy","desc":"Castell Coch, Welsh for 'Red Castle', is perched on a wooded hill in Cardiff, Wales. Built on the ruins of the old fortification, the renowned architect William Burges redesigned the castle between 1875 and 1879. The castle is a symphony of opulence, featuring lavish interiors adorned with intricate carvings, vibrant stained-glass and sumptuous furnishings. Its external features and high Victorian interiors stand as an example of the brilliance of its designer. Melding together remnants of the mediaeval fortress with 19th-century innovations, its design achieves a synthesis that is hailed as a highlight of the Gothic Revival in Britain. The surrounding beech forest contributes to the fairytale-like background, and it contains geological features of limestone, sandstone and rare plant species such as the butterfly orchid, bird's-nest orchid and dog's mercury. These woods are recognised and protected as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.","date":"20 Nov 2023","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231120_CastleCoch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"949a8571800a171f68fe51f3e3a427ec","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CastleCoch_ROW8419231737_tmb.jpg","title":"Castell Coch, Tongwynlais, South Wales","desc":"Castell Coch, Welsh for 'Red Castle', is perched on a wooded hill in Cardiff, Wales.
