The park was named after a series of Navajo sandstone domes that were said to resemble the US Capitol Building, while the Waterpocket Fold was referred to as a reef since it obstructed smooth transportation. Known as 'a wrinkle in the Earth's crust,' the Waterpocket Fold was carved by eons of erosion.

If alarmed, they freeze with their bill and neck pointing upwards. In winter they feast upon cotoneaster, juniper and rowan berries—the latter is their favourite. As spring casts its spell, these nomads engage in nesting. The female waxwings craft the nests, laying 2 to 6 bluish-grey eggs. The hatchlings are fed a diet of insects and fruits by both parents.
