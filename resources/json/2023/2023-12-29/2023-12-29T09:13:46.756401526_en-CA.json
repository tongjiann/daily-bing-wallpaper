Amsterdam's canal ring area, built around the turn of the 17th century, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city is also home to its fair share of restaurants, vintage shops and outdoor markets, especially in neighbourhoods like Oud-West, pictured in today's image.

The hump on their back, visible when they arch before a dive, contributes to their names. Known for their songs, these vocalizations are linked to mating and communication.
