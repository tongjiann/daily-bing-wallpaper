The wilderness' vast sand dunes, rocky plateaus, and occasional oases create a landscape like no other. Although it is the largest hot desert in the world, the Sahara is home to a variety of unique life, including drought-resistant plants like acacia and palm trees and hardy animals such as camels and fennec foxes. One of the Sahara's intriguing features is its constantly shifting sand dunes, pictured in today's image, some of which can reach heights of over 152 metres. The desert also holds historical significance; ancient rock art and fossils have been discovered, providing insights into early human civilisations and prehistoric creatures. Sandstorms are common, shaping the ever-changing scenery and adding to the mystique of this natural wonder.","date":"Dec. 10, 2023","bsTitle":"Each day a different dune","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231210_SaharaDunes%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"754aece558e79c993e27387de6873b35","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SaharaDunes_EN-CA5200526907_tmb.jpg","title":"Sand dunes in the Sahara, Algeria","desc":"The Sahara is a vast expanse of desert in North Africa that spans over 7,770,000 square kilometres.
