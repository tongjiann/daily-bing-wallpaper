You likely won't see them fly, but you might find a herd migrating from tundra to forest in the North Polar Region, North America, Northern Europe and Siberia. Their hooves can expand or shrink in size depending on the season and the quality of the ground, which keeps their heavy frame, crowned with antlers, standing on stable feet.","date":"25 Dec 2023","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231225_CaribouChristmas%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"86340b3cc769b3d0d68d2c0ba98117ef","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CaribouChristmas_ROW5557739793_tmb.jpg","title":"Reindeer running in snow","desc":"Don't be surprised if these reindeer take flight!

In their natural habitat, they primarily feed on krill and face threats from leopard seals, their main predator. Catch them in their natural habitat along with Adélie and macaroni penguins.
