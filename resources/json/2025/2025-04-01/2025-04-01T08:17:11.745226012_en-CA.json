March 25 is the day the One Ring was destroyed, bringing down Sauron and ending his dark reign. This day was launched in 2003 to encourage people to explore J.R.R. Tolkien's works. Schools, libraries and fans worldwide take part, reading passages aloud, discussing favourite moments and diving into the rich lore of Middle-earth. Some go all out with themed events, cosplay and even second breakfasts—because what better way to honour Tolkien than by feasting like a hobbit?","date":"Mar. 25, 2025","bsTitle":"In a hole, there was a story","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250325_HobbitHole%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"1f90daca7740178f7ac66d4f5916e605","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HobbitHole_EN-CA8754229294_tmb.jpg","title":"Tolkien Reading Day","desc":"Today is Tolkien Reading Day.

These extremely arid regions receive less than 6 centimetres of annual rainfall. Compared to other bush elephants, desert elephants have longer legs, broader feet and slightly smaller bodies. These resilient, herbivorous creatures migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes almost 70 kilometres in a single night, to find their favourite myrrh bushes.","date":"Mar. 24, 2025","bsTitle":"Tall grass feast","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250324_ElephantGrass%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"13aa00837656583dc03d3001c6a62267","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ElephantGrass_EN-CA8436870295_tmb.jpg","title":"African elephants in Namibia","desc":"Desert elephants, found in Namibia and Mali, are African bush elephants that have adapted to the harsh conditions of the Namib and Sahara…","hash":"vHmxrv1OrciqV2JoUmFBTX3R72kDr9nPjeOsr/4RBDg="}},{"startdate":"20250323","fullstartdate":"202503230400","enddate":"20250324","url":"/th?id=OHR.NebraskaStorm_EN-CA8250611097_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.NebraskaStorm_EN-CA8250611097","copyright":"Lightning and storm clouds at sunset near Bowman, Nebraska, United States (© john finney photography/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=world+meteorological+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250323_0400%22","title":"You can't silence thunder","caption":"World Meteorological Day","copyrightonly":"© john finney photography/Getty Images","desc":"Today, we celebrate World Meteorological Day, commemorating the founding of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) in 1950.
