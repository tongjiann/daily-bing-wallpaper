Beavers are remarkable creatures known for their dam-building skills, which create wetlands, benefiting numerous species. As North America's largest rodents, they can grow up to 3 feet long, not including their distinctive flat tails. Their continuously growing teeth, with thick enamel giving them an orange hue, are essential tools for gnawing on trees—a behavior that maintains both their dental health and their environment. No wonder their strong choppers make them one of nature's best engineers.

Nature's color wheel has long been linked to myths and legends, from Norse gods to the Irish leprechaun's pot of gold. But beyond folklore, the science behind rainbows is just as compelling. The first real explanation came from Theodoric of Freiberg, a German physicist, in 1304. He discovered that rainbows form when sunlight enters a raindrop, bends, reflects inside, and then bends again as it exits. This process splits light into its colors, creating the spectrum we see. The classic 'ROYGBIV' (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) doesn't tell the whole story—rainbows contain millions of colors blended together.","date":"Apr 3, 2025","bsTitle":"The sky is the limit","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250403_SaguaroRainbow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"76133497d06749a352833e07a7e5c607","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SaguaroRainbow_EN-US3149462337_tmb.jpg","title":"National Find a Rainbow Day","desc":"Have you ever spotted a rainbow and felt a little lucky?
