These streamlined fish, marked by sharp V-shaped stripes, move in near-perfect unison. Their slow, deliberate spirals aren't random—they're an evolutionary strategy that offers both safety in numbers and an edge in hunting. Blackfin barracudas are found throughout tropical waters, from the Red Sea to the central Pacific. During the day, they gather in tight, coordinated groups near the reef, scattering at dusk to pursue prey.","date":"Jul 27, 2025","bsTitle":"Shimmer in sync","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250727_BlackfinBarracuda%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"41e850f15f5df3147d932c65fbf6049f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BlackfinBarracuda_EN-US1227116811_tmb.jpg","title":"Barracudas at Shark Reef, Ras Mohammed National Park, Sinai Peninsula, Egypt","desc":"Being surrounded by a shimmering spiral of silver—that's what it feels like to encounter a school of blackfin barracuda at Shark Reef in Ras…","hash":"7qYh7PCvhONanMwFzShmkaTClvrsm0IZygSOqUyUb/0="}},{"startdate":"20250726","fullstartdate":"202507260700","enddate":"20250727","url":"/th?id=OHR.MangroveTwilight_EN-US0646432423_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.MangroveTwilight_EN-US0646432423","copyright":"Mangrove trees at twilight, Walakiri Beach, island of Sumba, Indonesia (© Boonchet Ch./Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=International+Day+for+the+Conservation+of+the+Mangrove+Ecosystem&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250726_0700%22","title":"Sentinels of the tide","caption":"International Day for the Conservation of the Mangrove Ecosystem","copyrightonly":"© Boonchet Ch./Getty Images","desc":"As twilight descends on Walakiri Beach on the island of Sumba, Indonesia, the silhouettes of mangrove trees stand like sentinels in the tide—graceful, resilient, and vital.

The city's distinctive palette of painted buildings—seen here from above—adds striking color to neighborhoods like Risco de San Juan, where homes are built into the hillsides. Founded in 1478, Las Palmas has a layered history shaped by Spanish colonization, maritime trade, and migration.

In nature, few creatures mirror that kind of togetherness better than the ashy woodswallow, pictured here. Native to South Asia, these birds are rarely seen alone.

Seen in the distance in today's image, this Renaissance masterpiece is built over what is believed to be the tomb of St. Peter, the first bishop of Rome. With its soaring dome dominating the skyline, the basilica is one of the largest churches in the world. Just beyond the basilica lies St. Peter's Square, where thousands gather for papal blessings. The Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel, which houses Michelangelo's famed ceiling, are other must-sees.

Spanning over 379 square miles, the park is divided into three main units: the North Unit, home to the visitor center and scenic Badlands Loop Road; and the Stronghold and Palmer Creek units. The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about one inch per year, revealing colorful bands of volcanic ash, silt, and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels, and saber-toothed cats.","date":"Jul 22, 2025","bsTitle":"Epic sunsets and ancient secrets","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250722_BadlandsSunset%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a0981af31affaab560afa8f4c651f208","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BadlandsSunset_EN-US5821746223_tmb.jpg","title":"Badlands National Park in South Dakota","desc":"As the sun sets over Badlands National Park, the landscape transforms into a stunning display of color.
