It feeds into Lake Couchiching and, eventually, the Trent–Severn Waterway, which connects Georgian Bay to Lake Ontario. Originally named 'Ouentironk' by the Huron-Wendat people, the lake was later renamed by British surveyor John Graves Simcoe in honour of his father.

This enchanting locale blends mountainous charm with pristine coastal beauty—the nearby Gulf of Orosei and the Gennargentu massif form a protected regional park. The coastline stretches 20 kilometres, featuring a mix of white sandy beaches and rocky cliffs, vibrant by day and lively on summer nights.
