These gentle giants of the sea have been gliding through warm waters for millions of years, minding their own business and munching on seagrass. But despite their laid-back nature, they face serious threats. There are three species of manatees: the West Indian, the Amazonian and the African manatee. The West Indian manatee, which includes the Florida manatee, can grow up to 4 metres long and weigh over 450 kilograms. These peaceful creatures spend most of their time grazing and napping. They have no natural predators, but human activity poses a major risk. Boat strikes are a leading cause of injury and death, as these marine mammals are too slow to dodge speeding vessels. Habitat loss and pollution also threaten their survival. Conservation efforts, including speed limits in manatee zones and habitat protection, have helped, but these sea cows still need all the support they can get.","date":"Mar 26, 2025","bsTitle":"Life below the surface","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250325_CrystalManatee%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"32eeb5e734d02cf9601ebf4b17ea6ee1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CrystalManatee_EN-IN9367417729_tmb.jpg","title":"Manatee in Crystal River, Florida, United States","desc":"Manatees don't rush through life—they float.

These extremely arid regions receive less than 7 centimetres of annual rainfall. Compared to other bush elephants, desert elephants have longer legs, broader feet and slightly smaller bodies. These resilient, herbivorous creatures migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes more than 60 kilometres in a single night, to find their favorite myrrh bushes.","date":"Mar 24, 2025","bsTitle":"Tall grass feast","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250323_ElephantGrass%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fe7bfffc6a6d2eed10f720932b53d41b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ElephantGrass_EN-IN8930309129_tmb.jpg","title":"African elephants in Namibia","desc":"Desert elephants, found in Namibia and Mali, are African bush elephants that have adapted to the harsh conditions of the Namib and Sahara…","hash":"vHmxrv1OrciqV2JoUmFBTX3R72kDr9nPjeOsr/4RBDg="}},{"startdate":"20250322","fullstartdate":"202503221830","enddate":"20250323","url":"/th?id=OHR.NebraskaStorm_EN-IN8540918083_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.NebraskaStorm_EN-IN8540918083","copyright":"Lightning and storm clouds at sunset near Bowman, Nebraska, United States (© john finney photography/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=world+meteorological+day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250322_1830%22","title":"You can't silence thunder","caption":"World Meteorological Day","copyrightonly":"© john finney photography/Getty Images","desc":"Today, we celebrate World Meteorological Day, commemorating the founding of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) in 1950.
