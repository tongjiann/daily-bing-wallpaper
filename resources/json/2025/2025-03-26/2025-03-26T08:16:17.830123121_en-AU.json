These extremely arid regions receive less than 7 centimetres of annual rainfall. Compared to other bush elephants, desert elephants have longer legs, broader feet and slightly smaller bodies. These resilient, herbivorous creatures migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes almost 70 kilometres in a single night, to find their favourite myrrh bushes.","date":"24 Mar 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250324_ElephantGrass%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5eeabb2d1b1d8ee6e5e008a2a9822628","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ElephantGrass_ROW7641940719_tmb.jpg","title":"African elephants in Namibia","desc":"Desert elephants, found in Namibia and Mali, are African bush elephants that have adapted to the harsh conditions of the Namib and Sahara…","hash":"vHmxrv1OrciqV2JoUmFBTX3R72kDr9nPjeOsr/4RBDg="}},{"startdate":"20250323","fullstartdate":"202503230700","enddate":"20250324","url":"/th?id=OHR.NebraskaStorm_ROW7518048455_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.NebraskaStorm_ROW7518048455","copyright":"Lightning and storm clouds at sunset near Bowman, Nebraska, United States (© john finney photography/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Nebraska&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250323_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Lightning and storm clouds at sunset near Bowman, Nebraska, United States","copyrightonly":"© john finney photography/Getty Images","desc":"Pictured here is the awe-inspiring anvil crawler lightning in Nebraska, United States—a state renowned for its tornadoes and thunderstorms, typically during spring and summer.
