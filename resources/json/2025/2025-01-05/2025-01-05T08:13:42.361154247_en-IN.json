Over 25 metres tall and more than 80 metres wide, it holds the distinction of being the widest waterfall in Vietnam. Located over 270 kilometres north of Hanoi, the waterfalls have gradually worn away their crest over the years, inching upstream. For most of the year, they flow as two distinct cascades, but come summer, when the rains swell the river, they merge into one big fall. Even with better roads, easier public transport and drone videos showing off the jaw-dropping beauty of the falls, Bản Giốc remains refreshingly off the beaten path.
