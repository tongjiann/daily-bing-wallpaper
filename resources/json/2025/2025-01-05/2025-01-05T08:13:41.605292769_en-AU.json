Native to the Indian subcontinent, these birds are found in forests and open woodlands. Their range spans from the Himalayan foothills to Sri Lanka, though they are absent in the arid areas of western India. There have been reports of plum-headed parakeets making their way to places like New York and Florida in the United States, and even parts of the Middle East. Parakeets are often spotted in flocks, chattering melodiously or indulging in their favourite fruits, seeds and blossoms. Their quick, agile flight and playful nature make them a delight in the wild or as beloved pets. Known for their distinctive calls that echo through the air, these birds are also capable of mimicking human speech.","date":"5 Jan 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250105_PlumParakeet%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b73a1a3aef94458c92417e52e5ac790b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PlumParakeet_ROW9086396762_tmb.jpg","title":"Plum-headed parakeet","desc":"Birds come in many shapes and colours, but few are as striking as the plum-headed parakeet, photographed at Shimoga, Karnataka, India, in…","hash":"wamhJ2aNEEsFkJ+DM8uCnpW6GuJ2YVf/662kazTJvS0="}},{"startdate":"20250104","fullstartdate":"202501040800","enddate":"20250105","url":"/th?id=OHR.VietnamFalls_ROW0032978772_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.VietnamFalls_ROW0032978772","copyright":"Bản Giốc – Detian Falls on the Quây Sơn River, Vietnam (© Shane P.
