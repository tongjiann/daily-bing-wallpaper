There are several species worldwide, but the European beech steals the spotlight in much of Europe. With its smooth grey bark, short trunk and sweeping branches, this tree is a standout in Belgium's forests, as shown in today's image. It grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained, fertile soils, taking up to 30 years to mature. Not only do these 50-metre tall trees dominate the landscape, but their wood is also used to make some of the sturdiest furniture, flooring and even kitchen tools. Wildlife such as black bears, foxes, squirrels, chipmunks and mice love them too—beech nuts, though slightly bitter, provide a feast for all kinds of critters. In winter, the beech forests in Belgium become even more enchanting.","date":"Jan. 26, 2025","bsTitle":"Ageing gracefully","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250126_FrostedBeech%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a40de0346e0d53742d4d388b93c991e3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FrostedBeech_EN-CA0729211596_tmb.jpg","title":"European beech forest, Belgium","desc":"Beech trees are pretty amazing.
