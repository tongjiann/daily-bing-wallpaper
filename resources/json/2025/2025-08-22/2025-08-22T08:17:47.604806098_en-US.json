Gliding through the ocean with flapping fins and polka-dot flair, the spotted eagle ray refuses to blend in. It doesn't crawl along the seabed like its stingray cousins—it flies underwater. The species gets its name from—you guessed it—its protruding snout, which resembles an eagle's beak, and its distinctive spotted back, which is unique to each individual, much like fingerprints. Their wing-like pectoral fins can span up to 10 feet. Near the base of the long tail are venomous spines, in case a predator gets too close. These rays aren't aggressive, but they're not defenseless either.","date":"Aug 15, 2025","bsTitle":"Winging it underwater","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250815_SpottedEagleRay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c10f0dc0afa888d9e6199889b3f893e4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpottedEagleRay_EN-US9227600044_tmb.jpg","title":"Spotted eagle rays in the Galápagos Islands","desc":"It's a bird, it's a plane, it's … a fish!

Welcome to Corona Arch, seen in today's image, a towering Navajo sandstone formation that offers big adventure without the big crowds. The Corona Arch Trail starts off easy but packs a punch of scenery: railroad tracks, slickrock scrambles, and even a metal cable assist make it more than just a walk in the desert. After 1.5 miles of walking, the payoff is big: a massive arch that's 140 feet wide and 105 feet high. It's so large that people once swung from it on ropes, until that was banned for safety reasons. Even without the adrenaline stunts, the hike offers beautiful views and unforgettable moments in the heart of Red Rock Country. Also known as Little Rainbow Bridge, it shares visual similarities with the iconic Rainbow Bridge arch near Lake Powell—but Corona Arch holds its own in a more peaceful setting.","date":"Aug 13, 2025","bsTitle":"Earth's open secret","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250813_CoronaArch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"065f7491376397b2b405e5c724f03a1e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CoronaArch_EN-US8928406175_tmb.jpg","title":"Corona Arch near Moab, Utah","desc":"Just outside Arches National Park in Utah lies a natural wonder that rises like a colossal doorway against the sky, drawing photographers…","hash":"S4ZALxV9FQJu3q7jrGsgz+UO4WIW3JP/GZsGkyG+k/M="}},{"startdate":"20250812","fullstartdate":"202508120700","enddate":"20250813","url":"/th?id=OHR.KenyaElephants_EN-US8723347309_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.KenyaElephants_EN-US8723347309","copyright":"African elephant herd, Amboseli National Park, Kenya (© Chase Dekker/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=World+Elephant+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250812_0700%22","title":"Wild, wise, and wonderful","caption":"World Elephant Day","copyrightonly":"© Chase Dekker/Minden Pictures","desc":"Big ears, bigger hearts—elephants are more than just icons of the wild.
