One of the most breathtaking places to observe the richness of forests is the Danum Valley Conservation Area in Sabah on the Malaysian island of Borneo, starring in today's image. This over 400-square-kilometre sanctuary is home to an ancient, 130-million-year-old rainforest, teeming with rare species like Bornean orangutans, clouded leopards and over 270 bird species.","date":"Mar 21, 2025","bsTitle":"Long live the trees","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250320_DanumValley%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0497ff3c4c27c04577c2e3ee87b9e50f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DanumValley_EN-IN8272296990_tmb.jpg","title":"Happy International Day of Forests!","desc":"March 21 marks the International Day of Forests, a global observance aimed at celebrating the vital role forests play in supporting…","hash":"9UA4RFP9cZmFeROyAUEohTU182S9rNtiZAjtgWZOkAY="}},{"startdate":"20250319","fullstartdate":"202503191830","enddate":"20250320","url":"/th?id=OHR.SpringDaffodils_EN-IN7375116904_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.SpringDaffodils_EN-IN7375116904","copyright":"Spring daffodils glow in the morning (© LedyX/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=March+equinox&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250319_1830%22","title":"Spring awakening","caption":"Spring equinox","copyrightonly":"© LedyX/Shutterstock","desc":"With the sun rising higher, the days grow longer, marking the arrival of spring.

Once classified as 'endangered,' their conservation status was upgraded to 'vulnerable' in 2016, thanks to dedicated efforts such as breeding programmes, reforestation initiatives and habitat preservation. Despite this progress, fewer than 2,000 pandas remain in the wild, primarily due to habitat loss caused by deforestation and farming. Efforts to protect bamboo forests and improve breeding programmes are vital to their survival. While pandas may be cute and cuddly, they're also environmental heroes.

Today is the Ides of March, a day steeped in Roman history and tradition. The term 'Ides' referred to the midpoint of the month in the Roman calendar, often marking the full moon. It was a time of celebration, with festivals and public gatherings. However, in 44 BCE, the Ides of March became synonymous with political upheaval, betrayal and an event that would trigger the fall of the Roman Republic. On that fateful day, Julius Caesar, Rome's powerful dictator, was assassinated by a group of senators. The conspirators, including his close ally Brutus, believed they were saving the Republic from Caesar's growing authority. Caesar was attacked near the Theatre of Pompey, but the tension of that moment echoed through the Roman Forum—the beating heart of Rome's political and social life.","date":"Mar 15, 2025","bsTitle":"Friends, Romans, countrymen","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250314_ForumRomanum%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"cc5e3c5ea1e0f9a7eda9054a94d2509a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ForumRomanum_EN-IN5328883568_tmb.jpg","title":"Ides of March","desc":"As Shakespeare wrote in his play 'Julius Caesar,' 'Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.'

This unique celebration takes place in the twin towns of Barsana and Nandgaon in Uttar Pradesh. It is observed the day after Laddu Holi, where women playfully shower men with laddoos. Rooted in the legend of Radha and Krishna, this festival brings an age-old tale to life. As the story goes, Lord Krishna, hailing from Nandgaon and regarded as the son-in-law of Vrishabhanu, wished to drench his beloved Radha and her friends in colours. However, when he and his companions arrived in Barsana, they were met with playful resistance—Radha and her friends chased them away with sticks.
