The scale is staggering: The festival grounds span about 4.5 million square feet and host 14 main tents, each seating thousands. Each year, visitors consume around 7 million liters of beer, along with mountains of pretzels, sausages, and gingerbread hearts. All beer served at Oktoberfest comes from Munich breweries and meets the strict standards of the Reinheitsgebot, the German Beer Purity Law.","date":"Sep 20, 2025","bsTitle":"A tale of brews and views","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250920_OktoberfestSwing%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7c31d5ffa1f13c29220b6c207caf3039","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OktoberfestSwing_EN-US7916182497_tmb.jpg","title":"Oktoberfest begins!","desc":"Every fall, Theresienwiese, a square in Munich, Germany, transforms into one of the world's largest festivals—Oktoberfest.

The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, led to a swift phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. Today, satellites show that the hole over Antarctica is shrinking.
