This UNESCO World Heritage Site along Germany's North Sea coast is a place where the tides redraw the landscape twice a day. When the tide retreats, it exposes vast mudflats, creating an ever-changing terrain that's home to an incredible ecosystem. With an area of 4,410 square kilometres, it is also the largest national park in Germany. It's a paradise for migratory birds like oystercatchers and red knots, seals and tiny creatures that thrive in the shifting sands. One of the best ways to experience the park is mudflat hiking. Guided tours let you walk across the seabed, squishing through the soft ground while learning about the creatures beneath your feet.","date":"8 Mar 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250308_WaddenSeaBiosphereReserve%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"709c63bd3876befc589f38499a4e60b6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WaddenSeaBiosphereReserve_ROW7751883694_tmb.jpg","title":"Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park, Germany","desc":"If you think a coastline is just a line where land meets sea, the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park is here to change your mind…","hash":"PqWthh3rGuoEKbHD91zD55/Yt8TeicenuJjn/sYanUM="}},{"startdate":"20250307","fullstartdate":"202503070800","enddate":"20250308","url":"/th?id=OHR.PlumBlossom_ROW7628300114_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.PlumBlossom_ROW7628300114","copyright":"Plum blossoms, China (© zhikun sun/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Pink+plum+blossom+in+China&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250307_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Plum blossoms, China","copyrightonly":"© zhikun sun/Getty Images","desc":"Plum blossoms, a muse for countless artists and writers, bloom as symbols of endurance and elegance.

Recognisable by its bright yellow, curved bill, this bird is often seen hopping on the ground in search of food. Its diet includes insects, seeds, fruits, berries, nuts and small reptiles, making it a key player in the ecosystem as both a predator and seed disperser. Social creatures, these hornbills are usually found in pairs or small groups, often foraging together. They nest in natural tree cavities, with the female sealing herself inside using a mud wall, leaving only a small slit through which the male feeds her and the chicks.
