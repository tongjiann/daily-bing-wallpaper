Hay baling plays a crucial role in agriculture worldwide. It involves cutting, drying, and packaging grasses to feed livestock during the colder months. The process depends heavily on the weather: the grass must be dry before it's baled, or it risks molding. Farmers must act quickly once a dry spell arrives, making it a seasonal race.","date":"Sep 10, 2025","bsTitle":"'Hay' there!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250910_YorkshireHay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b983836886a97ddb6a573ede69f5dd7c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YorkshireHay_EN-US8523120193_tmb.jpg","title":"Hay bales in North Yorkshire, England","desc":"'Make hay while the sun shines' may sound like an old proverb, but in farming it's a practical truth.

It builds its nest, called a drey, high in the fork of a tree using twigs to form a domed structure about 10 to 12 inches wide. The female featured here is gathering moss—one of several soft materials, along with bark, leaves, and grass, that line the nest and turn it into a snug, well-insulated retreat. These rodents may also take over tree hollows or abandoned woodpecker holes when available.","date":"Sep 9, 2025","bsTitle":"Twig by twig, she prepares","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250909_SwissSquirrel%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"989786968814aa5568a14f673510b7d6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SwissSquirrel_EN-US8185093853_tmb.jpg","title":"A Eurasian red squirrel in Switzerland","desc":"Quick, clever, and always on the move—meet the Eurasian red squirrel, a leafy treetop resident found across much of Europe and Asia.
