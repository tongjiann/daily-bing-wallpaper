Its iconic Moorish castle ruins and the 15th-century tower reflect its history as a medieval fortress. Stroll through narrow streets lined with flower-filled balconies, visit the picturesque church of Santa María de la Mesa or simply relax and take in the breathtaking views.

Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples.

Rocks can also contain fossils, the remnants of long-extinct organisms. Canada is home to some jaw-dropping geological wonders. Take Hopewell Rocks in New Brunswick, for example. These giant, flowerpot-like formations were carved by the Bay of Fundy's massive tides, which rise and fall by up to 14 metres daily. Then there's the Mingan Archipelago in Quebec.
