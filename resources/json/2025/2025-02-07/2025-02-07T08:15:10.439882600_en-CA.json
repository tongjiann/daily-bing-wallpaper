While plains zebras are thriving, mountain zebras face significant threats, such as poaching and habitat encroachment. Zebras play an essential role in the ecosystems they live in, coexisting with predators like lions and hyenas while shaping the grasslands they call home.","date":"Jan. 31, 2025","bsTitle":"Anything but plain","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250131_PlainsZebra%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"840932d2c730e44513dc7baf81b8a208","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PlainsZebra_EN-CA2255570448_tmb.jpg","title":"Happy International Zebra Day!","desc":"Celebrate the beauty of zebras on International Zebra Day!
