The northern wheatear weighs less than an ounce, but travels thousands of miles between its summer homes in Alaska and northern Canada to its wintering grounds in Africa. Its migration route is one of the longest for a bird its size. Unlike many backyard songbirds, wheatears prefer wide-open spaces with low vegetation, where they can sprint and pounce on insects.

Established in 828 CE by Boniface II of Tuscany, the commune gradually became a meeting point for traders, soldiers, and sailors—each group contributing to the evolution of the town's structure. Bonifacio is divided into two sections, with the 'vieille ville' (old town)—also known as 'la Haute Ville' (the Upper City)—standing on a high cliff within the original citadel walls.

Shaped by ancient glaciers, the lake is framed by dramatic cliffs and rugged terrain that echo its icy origins. Its most striking feature is the Trap Dike—a towering 1,200-foot rock canyon flanked by steep walls, making the lake one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the Adirondacks. Massive avalanches carved these cliffs, leaving behind the dramatic landscape that gave Avalanche Lake its name. The Avalanche Lake Trail begins at the Adirondack Loj, a well-known launch point for adventures in the High Peaks.
