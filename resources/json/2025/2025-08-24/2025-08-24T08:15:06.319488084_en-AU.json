Globally, there are around 20 species of wheatears. Today's image features the northern wheatear. It weighs less than a kilogram, but travels thousands of kilometres between its summer homes in Alaska and northern Canada to its wintering grounds in Africa.

Established in 828 CE by Boniface II of Tuscany, the commune gradually became a meeting point for traders, soldiers and sailors—each group contributing to the evolution of the town's structure. Bonifacio is divided into two sections, with the 'vieille ville' (old town)—also known as 'la Haute Ville' (the Upper City)—standing on a high cliff within the original citadel walls. Below, the marine area lines the narrow inlet with harbours, waterfront homes and a growing valley community.","date":"20 Aug 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250820_CitadelBonifacio%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d034bf8ad51a8ab4d9e32bf311c23378","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CitadelBonifacio_ROW5645693651_tmb.jpg","title":"The citadel in Bonifacio, Southern Corsica, France","desc":"Set at Corsica's southern edge, Bonifacio looks out across a narrow strait to Sardinia, its limestone cliffs towering above the waves…","hash":"MGQvaMm6gvr70GFIZ5lb4nK4cr301F6TxABXAacd8hA="}},{"startdate":"20250819","fullstartdate":"202508190700","enddate":"20250820","url":"/th?id=OHR.GipuzcoaSummer_ROW5551089786_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.GipuzcoaSummer_ROW5551089786","copyright":"Layers of flysch in Zumaia, Basque Country, Spain (© Eloi_Omella/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Zumaia&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250819_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Flysch in Zumaia, Basque Country, Spain","copyrightonly":"© Eloi_Omella/Getty Images","desc":"On the coast of Zumaia, in the Basque Country, lies one of the most stunning geological landscapes in Spain: the flysch.
