Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact.","date":"Mar. 12, 2025","bsTitle":"Standing strong","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250312_ChateauLoire%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"80e37a3bf4308cddfa7a0f135636fb88","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ChateauLoire_EN-CA0574990626_tmb.jpg","title":"Château de Sully-sur-Loire, Centre-Val de Loire, France","desc":"If you're a lover of history with a dash of drama, the Château de Sully-sur-Loire, in the centre of northern France, has you covered.

Observed on the Monday after clocks spring forward, it's a reminder that rest is essential for well-being. Research backs it up—short naps boost mood, enhance concentration and sharpen memory. Napping is also linked to lower stress and better heart health.

This concept was popularised by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century, though his suggestion to 'save candles' was more satirical than a serious proposal. Fast forward to the early 20th century, and many countries adopted DST to conserve fuel during wartime. Today, DST runs from March to November in around 70 countries, giving us eight months of extended evening light.","date":"Mar. 9, 2025","bsTitle":"The March of time","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250309_ItalyClock%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"30c63914485213311611ca58674582a7","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ItalyClock_EN-CA0044429164_tmb.jpg","title":"Daylight saving time begins","desc":"It's that time of year again—when clocks spring forward, stealing an hour of sleep but giving us longer evenings to enjoy.
