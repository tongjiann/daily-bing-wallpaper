Today is the Ides of March, a day steeped in Roman history and tradition. The term 'Ides' referred to the midpoint of the month in the Roman calendar, often marking the full moon. It was a time of celebration, with festivals and public gatherings. However, in 44 BCE, the Ides of March became synonymous with political upheaval, betrayal, and an event that would trigger the fall of the Roman Republic. On that fateful day, Julius Caesar, Rome's powerful dictator, was assassinated by a group of senators. The conspirators, including his close ally Brutus, believed they were saving the Republic from Caesar's growing authority. Caesar was attacked near the Theater of Pompey, but the tension of that moment echoed through the Roman Forum—the beating heart of Rome's political and social life.","date":"Mar 15, 2025","bsTitle":"Friends, Romans, countrymen","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250315_ForumRomanum%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b94c1b1866ea9ec8d59a07fddd2c9b63","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ForumRomanum_EN-US9379132630_tmb.jpg","title":"Ides of March","desc":"As Shakespeare wrote in his play 'Julius Caesar,' 'Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.'

The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy.

Daylight saving time (DST) starts today at 2 AM, except in Arizona and Hawaii, reminding us that time, quite literally, waits for no one. The idea is simple: maximizing daylight and reducing energy consumption by syncing our activities with the natural light cycle. This concept was popularized by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century, though his suggestion to 'save candles' was more satirical than a serious proposal. Fast-forward to the early 20th century, when many countries adopted DST to conserve fuel during wartime. The US officially standardized it in 1966 with the Uniform Time Act. Today, DST runs from March to November in around 70 countries, giving eight months of extended evening light.","date":"Mar 9, 2025","bsTitle":"The March of time","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250309_ItalyClock%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c4240de545e84d5824158a7eae87df8b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ItalyClock_EN-US7397391355_tmb.jpg","title":"Daylight saving time begins","desc":"It's the time of year again when clocks spring forward, stealing an hour of sleep but giving us longer evenings to enjoy.
