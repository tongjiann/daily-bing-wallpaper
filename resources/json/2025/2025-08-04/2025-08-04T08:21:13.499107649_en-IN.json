They support around 200,000 nomadic herder families and provide habitat for rare species like the Mongolian gazelle and snow leopard.

They protect shorelines from erosion, buffer communities against storms and serve as nurseries for countless marine animals.

The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about two centimetres per year, revealing colourful bands of volcanic ash, silt and clay.
