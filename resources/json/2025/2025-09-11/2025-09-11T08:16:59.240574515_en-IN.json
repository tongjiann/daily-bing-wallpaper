What truly sets this beach apart is its unique butterfly shape. While this distinctive form draws many curious tourists, it is the tranquil, uncrowded shoreline that has quietly made it one of South Goa's most cherished destinations. It is also said that, now and then, butterflies can be spotted fluttering among the surrounding plants and trees. Dolphins are also known to make playful appearances just off the shore. Unlike busier beaches like Anjuna and Calangute, this peaceful cove offers a more intimate encounter. The beach is also renowned for its vibrant marine life; at low tide, colourful crabs and starfish appear along the shore. Adding to its charm, the lush green forests that embrace the cove create a stunning natural backdrop, making every visit a picture-perfect experience.","date":"Sep 11, 2025","bsTitle":"Jewel beyond the tides","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250910_ButterflyBeach%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8dca8f8daa22c9eb36b0313a7dc6bc87","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ButterflyBeach_EN-IN0695823552_tmb.jpg","title":"Butterfly Beach in Canacona, South Goa","desc":"Only 6 kilometres north of Palolem Beach in South Goa's Canacona region, Butterfly Beach is a secluded cove where turquoise waters meet soft…","hash":"LUaEKlYv+UjH88Xz6TLhVTliQ8PvuKek4WXLW915pyo="}},{"startdate":"20250909","fullstartdate":"202509091830","enddate":"20250910","url":"/th?id=OHR.YorkshireHay_EN-IN0275886002_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.YorkshireHay_EN-IN0275886002","copyright":"Hay bales, North Yorkshire, England (© Nick Brundle Photography/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Yorkshire+England&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250909_1830%22","title":"'Hay' there!","caption":"Hay bales in North Yorkshire, England","copyrightonly":"© Nick Brundle Photography/Getty Images","desc":"'Make hay while the sun shines' may sound like an old proverb, but in farming it's a practical truth.

Farmers must act quickly once a dry spell arrives, making it a seasonal race.","date":"Sep 10, 2025","bsTitle":"'Hay' there!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250909_YorkshireHay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9c6cb7926082b0e7ce0cffc224c4eba0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YorkshireHay_EN-IN0275886002_tmb.jpg","title":"Hay bales in North Yorkshire, England","desc":"'Make hay while the sun shines' may sound like an old proverb, but in farming it's a practical truth.

As a basic human right, literacy is a powerful tool that opens the door to greater freedoms and active global citizenship.

Functional literacy means understanding the causes of deprivation and working to change them. It involves gaining skills to improve one's economic status and overall well-being. Recognising its far-reaching impact, International Literacy Day—observed each year on September 8 since 1967—serves as a reminder of how vital literacy is in building a better, more sustainable future for all. This year, the theme explores literacy in a digital age, where technology continues to reshape how people learn, communicate and participate in society.","date":"Sep 8, 2025","bsTitle":"Booked for the day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250907_OrchardLibrary%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"38d838095db2081cfe40eb87af9bb860","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OrchardLibrary_EN-IN9883780906_tmb.jpg","title":"International Literacy Day","desc":"Read it and believe it—literacy changes everything.
