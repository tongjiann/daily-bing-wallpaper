Also residing here is one of the most iconic symbols of the North American wilderness—the grizzly bear. Don't be fooled by their shaggy coats and lumbering walk—these predators can weigh up to 410 kilograms and still run at 56 km/h. Young grizzlies often 'play-fight' to build strength, sharpen survival skills and figure out their place in bear society.
