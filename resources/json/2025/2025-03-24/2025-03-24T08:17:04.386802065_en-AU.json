These extremely arid regions receive less than 7 centimetres of annual rainfall. Compared to other bush elephants, desert elephants have longer legs, broader feet and slightly smaller bodies. These resilient, herbivorous creatures migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes almost 70 kilometres in a single night, to find their favourite myrrh bushes.","date":"24 Mar 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250324_ElephantGrass%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5eeabb2d1b1d8ee6e5e008a2a9822628","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ElephantGrass_ROW7641940719_tmb.jpg","title":"African elephants in Namibia","desc":"Desert elephants, found in Namibia and Mali, are African bush elephants that have adapted to the harsh conditions of the Namib and Sahara…","hash":"vHmxrv1OrciqV2JoUmFBTX3R72kDr9nPjeOsr/4RBDg="}},{"startdate":"20250323","fullstartdate":"202503230700","enddate":"20250324","url":"/th?id=OHR.NebraskaStorm_ROW7518048455_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.NebraskaStorm_ROW7518048455","copyright":"Lightning and storm clouds at sunset near Bowman, Nebraska, United States (© john finney photography/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Nebraska&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250323_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Lightning and storm clouds at sunset near Bowman, Nebraska, United States","copyrightonly":"© john finney photography/Getty Images","desc":"Pictured here is the awe-inspiring anvil crawler lightning in Nebraska, United States—a state renowned for its tornadoes and thunderstorms, typically during spring and summer.

Their slower speed makes them one of the few types of lightning that the human eye can easily follow. These lightning bolts usually form high up in the sky, far above the ground—which is why they don't create loud thunder.  Nebraska's unique geography, with its Great Plains, makes it a hotspot for such phenomena.","date":"23 Mar 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250323_NebraskaStorm%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"dfd19e4efd57c634eb75355e09a4a2b1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NebraskaStorm_ROW7518048455_tmb.jpg","title":"Lightning and storm clouds at sunset near Bowman, Nebraska, United States","desc":"Pictured here is the awe-inspiring anvil crawler lightning in Nebraska, United States—a state renowned for its tornadoes and thunderstorms…","hash":"2Aim2EVOHCJf5FwsOz0em8ZF7jTUmceiXCGDrbX42jk="}},{"startdate":"20250322","fullstartdate":"202503220700","enddate":"20250323","url":"/th?id=OHR.CenoteLilies_ROW7401806022_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.CenoteLilies_ROW7401806022","copyright":"Water lilies at the surface of Cenote Nicte-Ha, Tulum, Mexico (© Franco Banfi/NPL/Minden)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Cenote+Nicte+Ha&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250322_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Cenote Nicte-Ha, Tulum, Mexico","copyrightonly":"© Franco Banfi/NPL/Minden","desc":"One of nature's most mesmerising freshwater wonders, Cenote Nicte Ha in Tulum, Mexico, is featured in today's image.
