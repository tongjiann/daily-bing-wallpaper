The black-winged stilt, with its long slender red legs, moves with quiet elegance through the shallows. At times their presence carries a sense of intimacy—two birds drifting close, their movements mirroring each other in a delicate choreography as if sharing a secret only the wetlands can hear. They hunt with patient precision, gently picking insects, larvae and tiny crustaceans from the water's surface. Every movement reflects a subtle mastery of their environment, shaped by patience and instinct.","date":"Sep 15, 2025","bsTitle":"Wading for a sign","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250914_Echasse%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"944e2ae4d3ad73e7a91a0c6ceea66ea9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Echasse_EN-IN1542383073_tmb.jpg","title":"Black-winged stilts, France","desc":"Across the shimmering lagoons of Africa, the winding deltas of Asia and the salt marshes of southern Europe, a graceful figure emerges…","hash":"7e7apCnkXoyhrIavoFKzS/CSBr/53ZfSyUSdp4ihHG4="}},{"startdate":"20250913","fullstartdate":"202509131830","enddate":"20250914","url":"/th?id=OHR.HohWaterfall_EN-IN1403285660_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.HohWaterfall_EN-IN1403285660","copyright":"A waterfall in Olympic National Park, Washington, United States (© Chris Moore/TANDEM Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Olympic+National+Park+Washington&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250913_1830%22","title":"Moss and mist","caption":"Olympic National Park, Washington, United States","copyrightonly":"© Chris Moore/TANDEM Stills + Motion","desc":"Olympic National Park covers a rare mix of terrain—and that's part of its unique appeal.

It is also said that, now and then, butterflies can be spotted fluttering among the surrounding plants and trees. Dolphins are also known to make playful appearances just off the shore. Unlike busier beaches like Anjuna and Calangute, this peaceful cove offers a more intimate encounter. The beach is also renowned for its vibrant marine life; at low tide, colourful crabs and starfish appear along the shore.

Functional literacy means understanding the causes of deprivation and working to change them. It involves gaining skills to improve one's economic status and overall well-being. Recognising its far-reaching impact, International Literacy Day—observed each year on September 8 since 1967—serves as a reminder of how vital literacy is in building a better, more sustainable future for all.
