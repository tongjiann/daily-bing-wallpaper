When prices crashed in 1637, fortunes were lost, but the love for tulips remained.","date":"Apr. 11, 2025","bsTitle":"A blooming good time","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250411_TulipsWindmill%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"322263115d441a55d344ac89fcfda1d7","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TulipsWindmill_EN-CA9221489477_tmb.jpg","title":"Tulips, Netherlands","desc":"From the famous tulip fields to the world's largest flower auction, the Netherlands and tulips go a long way back.
