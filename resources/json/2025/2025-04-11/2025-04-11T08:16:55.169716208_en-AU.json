By the 17th century, they became so valuable that a single bulb could cost more than a house. This period, known as 'tulip mania', is considered one of the first recorded financial bubbles. When prices crashed in 1637, fortunes were lost, but the love for tulips remained.","date":"11 Apr 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250411_TulipsWindmill%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d78acef360536e10c9f575e87d79b68f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TulipsWindmill_ROW8756634246_tmb.jpg","title":"Tulips, Netherlands","desc":"From the famous tulip fields to the world's largest flower auction, the Netherlands and tulips go a long way back.

Sibling play is essential, shaping their hunting and social skills while keeping things entertaining. Wrestling, pouncing and even playful ambushes are all part of the training.
