Their hooves shrink in winter to expose a gripping rim, then expand in warmer months for better traction. Still not impressed? Consider this: reindeer don't have an internal clock. Instead, their melatonin—the hormone that regulates sleep—adjusts to light and darkness, helping them stay awake through endless nights of gift delivery.","date":"Dec 23, 2025","bsTitle":"Where holiday magic runs on hooves","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251222_ReindeerFinland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1606bc9d3c322d2b68658302b240c8fc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ReindeerFinland_EN-IN8311415017_tmb.jpg","title":"Reindeer, Lapland, Finland","desc":"Few creatures evoke the magic of the holidays quite like the reindeer.

Among its most famous moments is the dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy—the ruler of the Land of Sweets—accompanied by music that has become iconic.
