On the crest of the Great Himalayas of southern Asia, along the border between Nepal and Tibet, stands Mount Everest. At over 8,800 metres, it is the world's highest peak and a symbol of human aspiration and natural beauty. In 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepali Sherpa climber, were the first to successfully reach its summit, marking a historic achievement in exploration. Its glaciers feed rivers sustaining millions, showing that mountains are more than scenery—they are lifelines.","date":"11 Dec 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251211_EverestGlow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"136709e141610bd05f30b4906705df2e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EverestGlow_ROW4955731519_tmb.jpg","title":"The summit of Mount Everest at sunset, seen from Renjo La, Nepal","desc":"From the rolling Alps to the towering Himalayas, mountains cover nearly a quarter of Earth's land and host 15% of the world's population and…","hash":"UgKS3RCNz50TruCvHIi+CKXY8RWixjed93DuGUazztk="}},{"startdate":"20251210","fullstartdate":"202512100800","enddate":"20251211","url":"/th?id=OHR.CastleAbruzzo_ROW4838323641_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.CastleAbruzzo_ROW4838323641","copyright":"Castle of Rocca Calascio, Abruzzo, Italy (© carlo alberto conti/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Castle+of+Rocca+Calascio&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251210_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Castle of Rocca Calascio, Italy","copyrightonly":"© carlo alberto conti/Getty Images","desc":"Among the silent crests of the Abruzzo Apennines in Italy, when autumn begins to touch the rocks with amber fingers, the Castle of Rocca Calascio appears like a mirage of stone and wind.
