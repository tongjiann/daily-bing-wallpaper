Since then, it has rebuilt itself into a place where modern museums, Baroque buildings and riverside views share the same frame. Much of the city's oldest architecture can be found in the boroughs of the Altstadt (Old Town) and Neustadt (New Town). The surrounding neighbourhoods, originally planned by Saxon monarchs in the 18th and 19th centuries, are named after Saxon sovereigns like Friedrichstadt and Albertstadt.","date":"23 Jun 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250623_DresdenElbe%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"979d9841adf185620c1813395957e0f8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DresdenElbe_ROW5477551321_tmb.jpg","title":"Elbe river in Dresden, Saxony, Germany","desc":"Berlin gets the buzz, Munich brings the beer, but what about Dresden, in Saxony, Germany?

By 1529, explorers had charted these waters and the name 'Santa Catarina' appeared on world maps. In the 18th century, waves of Azorean settlers arrived. The coast became a stage for disputes between Portugal and Spain, and in the centuries that followed, German and Italian immigrants added new colours to the region's tapestry.

The Asian swallowtail uses sophisticated colour vision and colour constancy to identify flowers, especially those in the citrus family, even under changing light conditions.
