Asteroid Day highlights ongoing research into asteroids and the potential threats they pose. Started in 2015 and backed by the United Nations, this day marks the anniversary of the Tunguska event—a massive explosion that occurred in Siberia on June 30, 1908. This explosion flattened over 800 square miles of Siberian forest near the Tunguska River. The blast released energy equal to 10–15 megatons of TNT, a standard measure of explosive force. Since then, craters like Arizona's Barringer, Quebec's Manicouagan, and others have helped scientists study what happens when space rocks hit Earth.","date":"Jun 30, 2025","bsTitle":"Rock-solid defense","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250630_WolfeCrater%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b42632d73c03dfc6b2028715008438bc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WolfeCrater_EN-US2390330059_tmb.jpg","title":"Asteroid Day","desc":"Each scar on Earth from a meteorite impact tells a story—from the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs to the lesser-known craters that dot…","hash":"8ca6OUKrolw3z28PXWG9kYI824FypBw6MIw7Wik7HWY="}},{"startdate":"20250629","fullstartdate":"202506290700","enddate":"20250630","url":"/th?id=OHR.BandaIsland_EN-US9494080788_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.BandaIsland_EN-US9494080788","copyright":"Blue lagoon at Pulau Ay, Banda Islands, Indonesia (© fabio lamanna/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Banda+Islands&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250629_0700%22","title":"Where history gets spicy","caption":"International Day of the Tropics","copyrightonly":"© fabio lamanna/Alamy","desc":"Every June 29, the International Day of the Tropics shines a light on the equator-hugging zone where the sun sticks around, and climate conversations get real.

Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, the uprising challenged not only police brutality but society's silence. Stonewall wasn't the beginning of queer existence, but it was the moment people said 'no more' loud enough to be heard worldwide. The first Pride marches came the next year, not as parties, but as protests. Thousands marched in New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago to mark the anniversary of Stonewall.

It spends its days snoozing on leaves and its nights foraging for insects. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark.

Since its humble beginnings in 1970, when tickets cost just one British pound, Glastonbury has grown into a cultural powerhouse, attracting over 200,000 fans each year. The festival is deeply rooted in the ideals of the hippie movement, the 1960s counterculture, and the free festival spirit that sparked its early days. From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young, and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael's Church Tower. The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore.","date":"Jun 25, 2025","bsTitle":"Tor and tunes: Glastonbury begins","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250625_GlastonburyScenic%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"155b6b2f48ad58438aa2e7b800d03025","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GlastonburyScenic_EN-US2433998806_tmb.jpg","title":"Glastonbury Festival begins","desc":"As the sun rises over the hills in Somerset, Glastonbury Festival comes alive, transforming a quiet part of South West England into one of…","hash":"byWjSAAO7wzeWEZYQNbw5kGyOrRXn0ttfGL2A3n92jU="}},{"startdate":"20250624","fullstartdate":"202506240700","enddate":"20250625","url":"/th?id=OHR.DelicateArch_EN-US2369284902_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.DelicateArch_EN-US2369284902","copyright":"Delicate Arch, Arches National Park, Utah (© mmac72/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Delicate+Arch+Arches+National+Park+Utah&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250624_0700%22","title":"Nature took its time","caption":"Delicate Arch, Arches National Park, Utah","copyrightonly":"© mmac72/Getty Images","desc":"This place wasn't built overnight—nature took its time to craft this masterpiece.
