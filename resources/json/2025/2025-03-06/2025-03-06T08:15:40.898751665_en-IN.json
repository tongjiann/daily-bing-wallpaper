They're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba. Polar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves. It is important that we reduce our carbon footprints and contribute to the conservation of these amazing predators.","date":"Feb 27, 2025","bsTitle":"Polar care","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250226_PolarCub%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"941bb562fb1ea4d3f7ad7a2ce1e9bb4b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PolarCub_EN-IN9075237601_tmb.jpg","title":"Polar bear cub, Churchill, Manitoba, Canada","desc":"Polar bears are native to the Arctic and can be found in Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Svalbard.

In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami, and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain. February 23 is celebrated as Mount Fuji Day (富士山の日) because the word 'Fujisan' can be interpreted as '2, 2, 3.' Although it's not a national holiday, people often take the opportunity to learn more about this majestic peak. It's also a day to reflect on the future of the mountain, and how it can be preserved for future generations. Every year, more than 300,000 people climb Mount Fuji, and overtourism has become a real concern.","date":"Feb 23, 2025","bsTitle":"Wind of Fuji, my souvenir from Edo","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250222_MtFujiSunrise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c27aba5c9f07084cefdcdc2518e672ab","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MtFujiSunrise_EN-IN8980088662_tmb.jpg","title":"Mount Fuji Day","desc":"Over 90 kilometres southwest of Tokyo stands one of Japan's cultural icons: Mount Fuji.

The stags have antlers that grow larger each year until maturity and are usually over 70 centimetres long, weighing around 1 kilogram. These antlers have long been a symbol of power and are the only mammal organ capable of complete regeneration. Females, or hinds, are slightly smaller and antler-free, as seen in today's image. Breeding season, known as the rut, is a time of dramatic display as males compete fiercely for mates through roaring and antler clashes.
