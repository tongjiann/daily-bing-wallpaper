One of the world's most beloved stage works, 'The Nutcracker,' is rooted in this very sense of magic. The story unfolds on Christmas Eve, in the midst of holiday cheer, when Clara receives a nutcracker as a gift. As night falls and the household drifts into sleep, the little girl and her nutcracker embark on a fantastical journey—battling the Mouse King and wandering through the Land of Sweets. Among its most famous moments is the dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy—the ruler of the Land of Sweets—accompanied by music that has become iconic. Tchaikovsky composed these enchanting melodies for the celesta, an instrument often called the bell-piano.","date":"Dec 22, 2025","bsTitle":"From Hoffmann's pages to global stages","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251222_NutcrackerAnkara%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"cbe1f2d71dfaef2f7003d9b65599a737","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NutcrackerAnkara_EN-US5537620581_tmb.jpg","title":"'The Nutcracker' performed by the Turkish State Opera and Ballet in Türkiye","desc":"As Christmas approaches, each sunset gives way to a glow of festive lights, bringing a touch of wonder and preparing us for the holiday…","hash":"sT8dD2fS0A+yArPVlq3x8JkgUfmJppM7dv4SFmRJ5rs="}},{"startdate":"20251221","fullstartdate":"202512210800","enddate":"20251222","url":"/th?id=OHR.SwedenSolstice_EN-US5470044971_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.SwedenSolstice_EN-US5470044971","copyright":"Dawn light through frosty trees, Sweden (© Schon/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Winter+solstice&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251221_0800%22","title":"Birth of the new sun","caption":"Winter solstice","copyrightonly":"© Schon/Getty Images","desc":"Ever felt as if the night just wouldn't end?
