Their name comes from the Sanskrit 'rajaputra,' meaning 'son of a king,' and they are celebrated for their noble lineage and martial traditions across northern India. The fort's stone walls have witnessed centuries of courage, pride and romance, remembered in the songs of Rajasthan's bards. According to legend, Bhim, a hero from the Hindu epic 'Mahabharata,' first laid its foundations.","date":"25 Sep 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250925_FortChittorgarh%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1f083482831ece647d2e81ab7e196bff","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FortChittorgarh_ROW5235971139_tmb.jpg","title":"Chittorgarh Fort, Rajasthan, India","desc":"High on a hill rising over 180 metres in Rajasthan, India, Chittorgarh Fort spans approximately 280 hectares.

The missing apostrophe in its official title follows standard geographic naming conventions—hence, the signs read 'Devils Tower.' In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed it as the nation's first national monument.","date":"24 Sep 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250924_BearLodge%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d9d417f9253abd68286a65058274ac72","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BearLodge_ROW5124769347_tmb.jpg","title":"Devils Tower National Monument, Wyoming, United States","desc":"Somewhere in the wide prairies of northeastern Wyoming in the United States, stands Devils Tower, a stone formation that rises from the open…","hash":"FMdxj+VSdgdfbexNuUDM7tkfyuHT6e1KgA8eJ/H+6x8="}},{"startdate":"20250923","fullstartdate":"202509230700","enddate":"20250924","url":"/th?id=OHR.ToucanForest_ROW4747613727_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ToucanForest_ROW4747613727","copyright":"Keel-billed toucan in Costa Rica (© Juan Carlos Vindas/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Keel+billed+toucan&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250923_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Keel-billed toucan, Costa Rica","copyrightonly":"© Juan Carlos Vindas/Getty Images","desc":"Spot a flash of yellow on its chest and a bill that looks painted by an artist—that's the keel-billed toucan. A member of the Ramphastidae family, which includes toucan barbets, it is one of more than 40 toucan species. Found from southern Mexico to northern Colombia, it spends much of its day plucking fruit with a rainbow-coloured bill about one-third of its total length. It also eats insects, eggs and small reptiles when available. The bill not only helps it eat but also keeps the toucan cool by radiating excess heat—thanks to the blood vessels running through it. This social bird often moves in small groups, chattering and gliding between treetops. With each wing measuring around 18-20 centimetres, the keel-billed toucan moults, or sheds its feathers, just once a year.","date":"23 Sep 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250923_ToucanForest%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1d6115eca7124ec9a09480b5ec79994e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ToucanForest_ROW4747613727_tmb.jpg","title":"Keel-billed toucan, Costa Rica","desc":"Spot a flash of yellow on its chest and a bill that looks painted by an artist—that's the keel-billed toucan.
