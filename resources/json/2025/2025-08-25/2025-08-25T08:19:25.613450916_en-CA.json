Tucked away in the Adirondack High Peaks in New York, United States, this 0.04-square-kilometres alpine lake sits at nearly 880 metres between Mount Colden and Avalanche Mountain. Shaped by ancient glaciers, the lake is framed by dramatic cliffs and rugged terrain that echo its icy origins. Its most striking feature is the Trap Dike—a towering 370 metre rock canyon flanked by steep walls, making the lake one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the Adirondacks. Massive avalanches carved these cliffs, leaving behind the dramatic landscape that gave Avalanche Lake its name.","date":"Aug. 18, 2025","bsTitle":"Stream a little dream","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250818_AvalancheLake%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"56e235c4da942a067e8b61b3d651e999","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AvalancheLake_EN-CA8229303307_tmb.jpg","title":"Avalanche Lake Trail at Adirondack High Peaks, New York, United States","desc":"There's no easing into the wild here—the Avalanche Lake Trail carves a bold path through rock scrambles, narrow ledges and alpine serenity…","hash":"X0gnZnowRZI1LwCILNRf2eEAd1IDsW6CuqapK7i3j1k="}},{"startdate":"20250817","fullstartdate":"202508170400","enddate":"20250818","url":"/th?id=OHR.LyngvigLighthouse_EN-CA8074234624_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.LyngvigLighthouse_EN-CA8074234624","copyright":"Lyngvig Lighthouse, Hvide Sande, Denmark (© Caroline Brundle Bugge/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=International+Lighthouse+Lightship+Weekend&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250817_0400%22","title":"One tall way to spot the sea","caption":"International Lighthouse Lightship Weekend","copyrightonly":"© Caroline Brundle Bugge/Getty Images","desc":"Built to brave storms and steer ships to safety, lighthouses now glow as symbols of heritage, wonder and connection.

Canada is home to over 800 native bee species, with honey bees playing a major role in pollinating crops like blueberries, apples and canola. Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan lead in honey production. Despite their superpowers, bees are in a sticky situation.
