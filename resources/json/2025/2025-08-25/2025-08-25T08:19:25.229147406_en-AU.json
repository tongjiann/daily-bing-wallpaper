This thermal-meets-canyon overlook offers front-row views of the Yellowstone River carving its way through a lava-forged canyon. The canyon walls formed about 1.3 million years ago, when lava flowed from the Yellowstone Plateau. As it cooled and cracked, it created the striking basalt formations seen today. Along the basalt cliffs, white mineral deposits that gave Calcite Springs its name are visible, formed by mineral-rich waters still steaming from underground. You might spot a bald eagle gliding overhead or bison lounging nearby. Yellowstone is more than just a park—it's a supervolcano with a visitor centre.","date":"25 Aug 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250825_YellowstoneRiver%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"73a82f9ec3b5d8b72ca91a3a5ba394e1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YellowstoneRiver_ROW6734170781_tmb.jpg","title":"Calcite Springs Overlook and Yellowstone River, Wyoming, United States","desc":"Calcite Springs Overlook in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming—featured in today's image—is located just off the Grand Loop Road.

Globally, there are around 20 species of wheatears. Today's image features the northern wheatear. It weighs less than a kilogram, but travels thousands of kilometres between its summer homes in Alaska and northern Canada to its wintering grounds in Africa.

Established in 828 CE by Boniface II of Tuscany, the commune gradually became a meeting point for traders, soldiers and sailors—each group contributing to the evolution of the town's structure. Bonifacio is divided into two sections, with the 'vieille ville' (old town)—also known as 'la Haute Ville' (the Upper City)—standing on a high cliff within the original citadel walls.
