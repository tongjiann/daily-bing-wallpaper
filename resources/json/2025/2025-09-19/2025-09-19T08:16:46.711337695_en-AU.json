Hay baling plays a crucial role in agriculture worldwide. It involves cutting, drying and packaging grasses to feed livestock during the colder months. The process depends heavily on the weather: the grass must be dry before it's baled, or it risks moulding. Farmers must act quickly once a dry spell arrives, making it a seasonal race.","date":"10 Sep 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250910_YorkshireHay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f22c9139f57e78834da0abed1c8ce9b1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YorkshireHay_ROW7331770812_tmb.jpg","title":"Hay bales in North Yorkshire, England","desc":"'Make hay while the sun shines' may sound like an old proverb, but in farming it's a practical truth.
