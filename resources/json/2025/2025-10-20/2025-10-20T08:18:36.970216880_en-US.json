That's exactly what sloths do, and today, we celebrate them. International Sloth Day honors these unhurried creatures and reminds us that life doesn't always need to be rushed. Sloths are tree-dwelling mammals native to Central and South America. Their deliberate movements conserve energy, avoid predators, and even allow algae to grow on their fur, creating green camouflage among the canopy. Hoffmann's two-toed sloth, pictured here, is a prime example of the slow-paced lifestyle typical of all sloths. It spends most of its time in the trees, occasionally descending to the ground to move to a new one.","date":"Oct 20, 2025","bsTitle":"Life in the slow lane","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251020_HoffmansSloth%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9bdeecf354b647e3c33fcc669b61f41f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HoffmansSloth_EN-US3030106938_tmb.jpg","title":"International Sloth Day","desc":"How good would it feel if you could just hang out and do absolutely nothing all day?

Its unique architecture has roots in the late 19th century. Sailors and merchants carved houses right into the volcanic cliffs—cool in summer and warm in winter. The white-and-blue theme is also more than just for show: houses were painted with lime wash so rainwater would run off and be collected.
