However, it conceals a 4,500-year-old Neolithic enigma. Starting around 2400 BCE, chalk was locally quarried, transported and compacted by hand, layer by layer, over generations. The result is the tallest prehistoric mound in Europe, built entirely by human effort, rising to almost 40 metres.","date":"18 Oct 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251018_SilburyHill%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f87f46fbd9eb70c8322dc4c9f17c3870","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SilburyHill_ROW9508999634_tmb.jpg","title":"Silbury Hill, Wiltshire, England","desc":"Some ancient sites, like the one shown here, blend seamlessly into their surroundings: at first glance, Silbury Hill in Wiltshire, England…","hash":"BaMrFbQQY8PAjHT4yO4wVhPV9rDQiB7PaErkil8lTiE="}},{"startdate":"20251017","fullstartdate":"202510170700","enddate":"20251018","url":"/th?id=OHR.RockRiverFalls_ROW9398171921_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.RockRiverFalls_ROW9398171921","copyright":"Rock River Falls, Upper Peninsula, Michigan, United States (© Matt Anderson Photography/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Rock+River+Wilderness+Michigan&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251017_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Rock River Falls, Michigan","copyrightonly":"© Matt Anderson Photography/Getty Images","desc":"Nestled within Rock River Canyon Wilderness, in Michigan, United States, Rock River Falls emerges amid a landscape shaped by glaciers, dense woods and layers of history.

Its unique architecture has roots in the late 19th century. Sailors and merchants carved houses right into the volcanic cliffs—cool in summer and warm in winter. The white-and-blue theme is also more than just for show: houses were painted with lime wash so rainwater would run off and be collected.
