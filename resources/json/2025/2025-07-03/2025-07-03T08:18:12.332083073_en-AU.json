The water that bubbles up here comes from an almost 200,000-hectare area and eventually flows into the Withlacoochee River.","date":"3 Jul 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250703_RainbowRiver%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"184ec9023636ce0baeafc0d5af783d3b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RainbowRiver_ROW4765713461_tmb.jpg","title":"Rainbow River, Rainbow Springs State Park, Florida, United States","desc":"Nestled in the northern Gulf Coast of Florida in the United States is Rainbow Springs State Park.

This fish is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place.
