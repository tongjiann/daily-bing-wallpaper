This ancient formation, pictured here, seems as if nature itself has sculpted a mythical creature forever poised to drink from the sea. Estimated to be 500 million years old, the rock's uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion. As one of the region's oldest and most iconic landmarks, it attracts hikers, photographers and nature lovers year-round. The best views are from the elevated track between Camel Rock and Murunna Point, while the more daring can scramble around from Camel Rock Surf Beach, though only safely at low tide.","date":"26 Jun 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250626_HorseheadRock%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f7d9c5b062166313440367817d9c1374","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HorseheadRock_ROW5697614901_tmb.jpg","title":"Horse Head Rock, New South Wales, Australia","desc":"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink—unless, of course, you're talking about Horse Head Rock, perched off the Sapphire…","hash":"2bZ2Po1e/zaMm5z6jPFqAvU3PvK6fC6ffRcOuUtZDMI="}},{"startdate":"20250625","fullstartdate":"202506250700","enddate":"20250626","url":"/th?id=OHR.GlastonburyScenic_ROW5625321891_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.GlastonburyScenic_ROW5625321891","copyright":"St. Michael's Church Tower on Glastonbury Tor, Glastonbury, Somerset, England (© Gavin Hellier/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Glastonbury+Tor&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250625_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"St. Michael's Church Tower on Glastonbury Tor, Glastonbury, Somerset, England","copyrightonly":"© Gavin Hellier/Getty Images","desc":"Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, is a hill crowned by the 14th-century St Michael's Church Tower—a Grade I listed building. The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore. Sometimes, when the air and ground temperatures are just right, the Tor looks like it's floating above the mist—a trick of the light called a Fata Morgana. The name comes from Morgan le Fay, a sorceress in Arthurian legends. The Tor stands in the heart of the Summerland Meadows, which are part of the Somerset Levels. It rises to an elevation of 158 metres and is clearly visible from far away, making it a striking landmark. Although often described as an island, the Tor actually sits at the western tip of a peninsula, surrounded on three sides by the River Brue.","date":"25 Jun 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250625_GlastonburyScenic%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"08ee67b7a733cd934d2e5f3e3c7706ec","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GlastonburyScenic_ROW5625321891_tmb.jpg","title":"St. Michael's Church Tower on Glastonbury Tor, Glastonbury, Somerset, England","desc":"Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, is a hill crowned by the 14th-century St Michael's Church Tower—a Grade I listed building.
