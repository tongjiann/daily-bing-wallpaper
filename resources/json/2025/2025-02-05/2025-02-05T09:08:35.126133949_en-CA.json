With its striking dark features and a knack for thriving in places others wouldn't, this British breed has turned the idiom on its head. Far from an outcast, it's the backbone of Scotland's rural life and a true champion of the hills and moors. Interestingly, the Blackface sheep didn't originate in Scotland but south of the Anglo-Scottish border. The breed's history is fascinating, and varieties such as the large-framed Perth and the medium-framed Lanark types are found across the United Kingdom. Though it's the most common breed in the region, the Blackface sheep has spread across the world, including the United States. Its coarse fleece is perfect for making durable products like carpets and tweeds—definitely not your average sweater material.","date":"Feb. 5, 2025","bsTitle":"Baa, baa, black sheep?

Legend has it that if he emerges from his burrow on February 2 and sees his own shadow, Canadians brace for an extended winter; no shadow means an early spring is on the way. Though it is celebrated mostly in Ontario, other places like Nova Scotia and Quebec also take part in the fun. The tradition has deep roots, first appearing in the early 1800s when European settlers brought similar customs to North America. Historically, Europeans celebrated today as the first day of spring, and Germans originally watched badgers and other small animals for signs of seasonal change important to farmers.","date":"Feb. 2, 2025","bsTitle":"Weather or not","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250202_AustriaMarmot%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d10076c488b0fc31f0f3bf8034ab9c76","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AustriaMarmot_EN-CA2613536224_tmb.jpg","title":"Groundhog Day","desc":"It's Groundhog Day… again.
