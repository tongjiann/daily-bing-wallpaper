Over time, layers of sandstone cracked, shifted, and slowly wore away, revealing more than 2,000 natural arches. These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognized as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971.","date":"Jun 24, 2025","bsTitle":"Nature took its time","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250624_DelicateArch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f40b1f144417b63cf81656fc58de6a7a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DelicateArch_EN-US2369284902_tmb.jpg","title":"Delicate Arch, Arches National Park, Utah","desc":"This place wasn't built overnight—nature took its time to craft this masterpiece.
