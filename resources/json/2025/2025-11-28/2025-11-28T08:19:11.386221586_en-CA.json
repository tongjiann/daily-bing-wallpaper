That's exactly the spirit of World Hello Day, celebrated every November 21. This cheerful observance began in 1973 when two American brothers, Brian and Michael McCormack, launched it as a peaceful response to global tensions. They mailed 1,360 letters in seven languages to world leaders, inviting them to join the first celebration. Their message was simple yet powerful: personal communication can help preserve peace. Today, people in more than 180 countries participate.","date":"Nov. 21, 2025","bsTitle":"Sealed with a hello","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251121_SealWaving%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4141d6a32572a13153d9a8c9c4e6b630","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SealWaving_EN-CA4973524052_tmb.jpg","title":"World Hello Day","desc":"This harbour seal, photographed at Robert Moses State Park on Long Island in New York, United States, seems to be onto something—spreading…","hash":"oTrrEiMVdrJxScrXnZdB84Dx/w7o1OYXKDIICjOP/2Y="}},{"startdate":"20251120","fullstartdate":"202511200500","enddate":"20251121","url":"/th?id=OHR.SaypeGeneva_EN-CA4761579611_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.SaypeGeneva_EN-CA4761579611","copyright":"Artist Saype poses with his land art painting at UN Headquarters, Geneva, Switzerland (© Valentin Flauraud/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=World+Childrens+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251120_0500%22","title":"Sketched into history","caption":"World Children's Day","copyrightonly":"© Valentin Flauraud/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock","desc":"On the lawns of the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, two children lean over a blank page, sketching the world as they dream it could be.
