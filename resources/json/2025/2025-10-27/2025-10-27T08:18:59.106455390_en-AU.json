Its enormous, arched bill—pale at the base and close to 8 centimetres long—is the largest among perching birds. These ravens live mostly between 1,500 and 3,400 metres above sea level, found across farmland, rocky cliffs and even rooftops in mountain towns.","date":"27 Oct 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251027_AfricanRaven%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6be29922bb8a07c2c1c9353f1f982c38","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AfricanRaven_ROW0614133197_tmb.jpg","title":"Thick-billed raven","desc":"Perched high in the mountains of Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia, the thick-billed raven holds the title of the world's largest raven.

Walking through the fields, you'll spot pumpkins of all shapes and sizes, from small decorative varieties to the giants that have inspired growers worldwide. Interestingly, the heaviest pumpkin ever recorded weighed an incredible 1,246.9 kilograms. Despite their solid appearance, pumpkins can float effortlessly because they are 92% water. These gourds have rolled their way into pies, porches, lattes and parades. The colour of pumpkins comes from beta-carotene, but not all are orange—some grow white, green or even blue. Their utility doesn't end there—pumpkins have stood guard as scarecrows, been launched in pumpkin-chucking contests and even hollowed out for boat races.","date":"26 Oct 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251026_PumpkinFarm%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"464b3649981f8420c5d218c512c6f006","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PumpkinFarm_ROW0518823159_tmb.jpg","title":"Pumpkin farm, North Carolina","desc":"A pumpkin farm is a patchwork of colour, life and tradition, with every gourd waiting its turn to shine.
