It isn't just a crossing—it's a cultural icon shining over the Jin River. Its name literally translates as 'Bridge of Peace and Propitiousness,' reflecting its role as both a practical crossing and a symbol of the city. The original bridge was built in 1746 but suffered repeated damage from floods over the centuries. The current structure, completed in 2003, preserves the architectural style of the Ming and Qing dynasties and spans 81 metres in length and 6 metres in width. The bridge features handrails with traditional floral carvings, water-beast statues on the piers and memorial archways on each side, reflecting classic Chinese architecture. It serves as a cultural landmark and a hub for tourism, featuring a restaurant on the upper level, hosting occasional cultural events and offering an illuminated night view that has become one of Chengdu's most photographed attractions.","date":"6 Oct 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251006_AnshunBridge%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fe7e58ffacaf45009196c34f4bb82962","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AnshunBridge_ROW9179881328_tmb.jpg","title":"Anshun Bridge, Chengdu, China","desc":"Today's image features the Anshun Bridge in Chengdu, China.

Its solar arrays soak up sunlight to power groundbreaking research on microgravity, technology and human survival beyond our planet. Shot from the SpaceX Crew Dragon Endeavour—a reusable spacecraft that has completed six missions since 2020, ferrying astronauts and cargo—this scene embodies what humanity can achieve when it chooses cooperation over competition.

On calm days, Mount Moran can be seen mirrored on the water's surface, making the scene even more striking.
