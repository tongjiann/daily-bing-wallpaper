Sunlight filters through its open surface, supporting vibrant aquatic life. For the ancient Maya, cenotes were sacred portals to the underworld and vital water sources in the Yucatán Peninsula. With a maximum depth of approximately 10 metres, Cenote Nicte Ha remains a popular spot for snorkelling and diving, offering a glimpse into an ancient and fragile ecosystem.
