Wide, clean and ready for volleyball or just flopping down with a good book, it's ideal for sunbathers and sandcastle architects alike. And yes, 'Baywatch' was filmed along Santa Monica Bay.

And it's not just their strength and speed that impress; a grizzly's sense of smell is so powerful, it can detect food from over 30 kilometres away—seven times better than a bloodhound's. Once widespread across the western United States, grizzlies now primarily roam Alaska and parts of the Northern Rockies.

Their mouths can stretch over a metre wide, but they feed by suction, not biting. Each has a unique pattern of white spots and stripes—no two alike—used by researchers to track individuals. Their breeding patterns remain largely a mystery, but they are ovoviviparous, meaning pups hatch inside the mother before being born alive.
