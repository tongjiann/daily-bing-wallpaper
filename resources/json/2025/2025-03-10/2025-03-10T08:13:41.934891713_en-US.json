You're not alone—losing an hour to daylight saving time can leave anyone groggy. That's why Napping Day exists. Introduced in 1999 by William Anthony, a Boston University professor, and his wife, Camille, this unofficial holiday encourages everyone to take quality naps. Observed on the Monday after clocks spring forward, it's a reminder that rest is essential for well-being. Research backs it up—short naps boost mood, enhance concentration, and sharpen memory. Napping is also linked to lower stress and better heart health. While power naps (20-30 minutes) are ideal for a quick recharge, even a few minutes of shut-eye can help.","date":"Mar 10, 2025","bsTitle":"Snooze and conquer","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250310_NappingLion%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ab665e88a0789914e3fa68ff30463052","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NappingLion_EN-US8441298325_tmb.jpg","title":"National Napping Day","desc":"Feeling a bit tired?

Daylight saving time (DST) starts today at 2 AM, except in Arizona and Hawaii, reminding us that time, quite literally, waits for no one. The idea is simple: maximizing daylight and reducing energy consumption by syncing our activities with the natural light cycle. This concept was popularized by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century, though his suggestion to 'save candles' was more satirical than a serious proposal. Fast-forward to the early 20th century, when many countries adopted DST to conserve fuel during wartime. The US officially standardized it in 1966 with the Uniform Time Act. Today, DST runs from March to November in around 70 countries, giving eight months of extended evening light.","date":"Mar 9, 2025","bsTitle":"The March of time","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250309_ItalyClock%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c4240de545e84d5824158a7eae87df8b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ItalyClock_EN-US7397391355_tmb.jpg","title":"Daylight saving time begins","desc":"It's the time of year again when clocks spring forward, stealing an hour of sleep but giving us longer evenings to enjoy.
