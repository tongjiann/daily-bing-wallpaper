The bond may stretch over time and distance, but it seldom fades. In nature, few creatures mirror that kind of togetherness better than the ashy woodswallow, pictured here. Native to South Asia, these birds are rarely seen alone. They gather in tight groups on bare branches or perch atop high places like powerlines.

The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of 2 centimetres per year, revealing colourful bands of volcanic ash, silt and clay.
