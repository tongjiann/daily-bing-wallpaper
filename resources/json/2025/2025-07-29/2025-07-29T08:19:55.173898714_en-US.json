They are apex predators, essential to the health and balance of the ecosystems they inhabit. By keeping prey populations like deer and wild boar in check, tigers help shape vegetation patterns and support the overall biodiversity of their environments.","date":"Jul 29, 2025","bsTitle":"The jungle queen","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250729_TigerDay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6e52e38a3b7f2a06221dea63198015ef","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TigerDay_EN-US5038876410_tmb.jpg","title":"International Tiger Day","desc":"Think you can hear silence?

The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about one inch per year, revealing colorful bands of volcanic ash, silt, and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels, and saber-toothed cats.","date":"Jul 22, 2025","bsTitle":"Epic sunsets and ancient secrets","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250722_BadlandsSunset%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a0981af31affaab560afa8f4c651f208","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BadlandsSunset_EN-US5821746223_tmb.jpg","title":"Badlands National Park in South Dakota","desc":"As the sun sets over Badlands National Park, the landscape transforms into a stunning display of color.
