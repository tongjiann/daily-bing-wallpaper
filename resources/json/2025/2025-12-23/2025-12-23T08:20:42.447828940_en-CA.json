Sturdy and sure-footed, they've been pulling Santa's sleigh ever since Clement Clarke Moore cast them in the role in his 1823 poem 'A Visit from Saint Nicholas.' And they were born for it. Their hooves shrink in winter to expose a gripping rim, then expand in warmer months for better traction.","date":"Dec. 23, 2025","bsTitle":"Where holiday magic runs on hooves","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251223_ReindeerFinland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"676ffec71453e526a8b1765405cb9d10","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ReindeerFinland_EN-CA1872537703_tmb.jpg","title":"Reindeer, Lapland, Finland","desc":"Few creatures evoke the magic of the holidays quite like the reindeer.

As night falls and the household drifts into sleep, the girl and her nutcracker embark on a fantastical journey—battling the Mouse King and wandering through the Land of Sweets. Among its most famous moments is the dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy, accompanied by music that has become iconic.","date":"Dec. 22, 2025","bsTitle":"From Hoffmann's pages to global stages","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251222_NutcrackerAnkara%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"ecd3b60e8a29b4602daa91bd5580a170","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NutcrackerAnkara_EN-CA0772457204_tmb.jpg","title":"'The Nutcracker' performed by the Turkish State Opera and Ballet in Türkiye","desc":"As Christmas approaches across Canada, each sunset gives way to a soft glow of festive lights—from window candles in Toronto homes to snowy…","hash":"wL5yY1KpTK+l6AawYb4vaIZFgzMwKnD7jPhJ77baXIQ="}},{"startdate":"20251221","fullstartdate":"202512210500","enddate":"20251222","url":"/th?id=OHR.SwedenSolstice_EN-CA1532001237_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.SwedenSolstice_EN-CA1532001237","copyright":"Dawn light through frosty trees, Sweden (© Schon/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Winter+solstice&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251221_0500%22","title":"Birth of the new sun","caption":"Winter solstice","copyrightonly":"© Schon/Getty Images","desc":"Ever felt as if the night just wouldn't end?
