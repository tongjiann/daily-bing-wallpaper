Meet the gnome—known as 'tomte' in Sweden and 'nisse' in Norway—whose traditions vary across regions. Rooted in Scandinavian folklore, these tiny guardians watch over homes and farms, keeping families safe through long, dark winters. But there's a catch: treat them kindly, or they may play tricks. A warm bowl of porridge on Christmas Eve is their favorite reward. Said to bring luck and laughter, they might even befriend your garden gnomes, since they often resemble them.","date":"Dec 16, 2025","bsTitle":"Tiny hats, big spirits","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251216_ChristmasGnomes%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0961c7f63c64ac354b541cab895daa28","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ChristmasGnomes_EN-US5094302697_tmb.jpg","title":"Handmade gnomes at a Christmas market","desc":"They've got long beards, red hats, and a knack for stealing a tad bit of Santa's thunder every Christmas.

Instead of hunting for bargains, they hunt for birds—with pencils, rather than pellets. Started in 1900 by ornithologist Frank M. Chapman, the count offered a peaceful alternative to the Christmas 'side hunts,' where people competed to shoot the most animals. Chapman had a better idea: count them instead. Over a century later, that simple shift has grown into the world's longest-running citizen-science project.","date":"Dec 14, 2025","bsTitle":"The great holiday bird-off","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251214_TuftedTitmouse%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"252cfea6c8a498ddd073cf52783f185c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TuftedTitmouse_EN-US4835376471_tmb.jpg","title":"Audubon Christmas Bird Count","desc":"Each December, thousands swap wrapping paper for binoculars and step outside for a different kind of holiday tradition: the Audubon…","hash":"HfHsxhUVkbr2Iz29bHzNvTAwfUWHvfuz7D+kbVdnDd8="}},{"startdate":"20251213","fullstartdate":"202512130800","enddate":"20251214","url":"/th?id=OHR.YosemiteWinter_EN-US4786605896_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.YosemiteWinter_EN-US4786605896","copyright":"Merced River, Yosemite National Park, California (© Ron and Patty Thomas/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Merced+River&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251213_0800%22","title":"Frozen reflections","caption":"Merced River, Yosemite National Park, California","copyrightonly":"© Ron and Patty Thomas/Getty Images","desc":"Every masterpiece needs a brushstroke to tie it together.
