These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles. While much of the terrain remains rugged, some areas offer easy access, allowing visitors to explore without strenuous hiking.","date":"Apr. 2, 2025","bsTitle":"Waves of time","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250402_UtahBadlands%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3a942df5271f104aceb9cf0a0f309666","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.UtahBadlands_EN-CA2102882917_tmb.jpg","title":"Sandstone formations in the badlands near Caineville, Utah, United States","desc":"Wavy sandstone ridges stretch across the Caineville Badlands, Utah, in the United States, resembling nature's brushstrokes on stone.

Some, like the glass frog, are nearly transparent, while others are extremely poisonous. The golden poison frog, for example, carries enough toxin to take down ten humans.
