The landscape hums with echoes of the past: dinosaurs left footprints on these cliffs long before Mesolithic hunters traced its streams over 8,000 years ago. In the 9th century, seafaring Norse Vikings settled here. Centuries later, the powerful MacLeod and MacDonald clans claimed these lands, their castles standing guard over countless battles and alliances.","date":"3 Oct 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251003_SkyeHeather%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"038217b8a5b9ad20e5b5a405d056f19f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SkyeHeather_ROW6254655210_tmb.jpg","title":"Glen Brittle, Isle of Skye, Scotland","desc":"Mists curl, waters glimmer and legends linger—welcome to Glen Brittle.

One such gem is the Snake River, which winds through Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, United States. A particularly stunning spot along this river is Oxbow Bend—featured in today's image—where calm waters reflect the towering Teton Range and wildlife such as moose and bald eagles thrive. On calm days, Mount Moran can be seen mirrored on the water's surface, making the scene even more striking. Here, water flows freely, unbound by concrete or commerce, protected by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. At dawn, mist dances over the bend and the mountains blush with the first light.
