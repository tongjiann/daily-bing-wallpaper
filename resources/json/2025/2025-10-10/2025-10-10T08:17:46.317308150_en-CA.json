Fiji Day is a unique national holiday—part reflection, part celebration. The day begins with formal ceremonies, where the Fijian flag is hoisted and leaders deliver speeches. Schools and community groups often stage reenactments and performances. Streets fill with parades, villages host cultural dances like the meke and rugby pitches come alive with matches. Families prepare traditional dishes like lovo, where meat and root crops are cooked underground, and kokoda, a citrus-marinated fish dish.","date":"Oct. 10, 2025","bsTitle":"A reef of reflection","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251010_MonurikiFiji%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5ce922129c11a8bd40cc88705acd66c4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MonurikiFiji_EN-CA8167749404_tmb.jpg","title":"Fiji Day","desc":"Some dates mark a single milestone—Fiji's October 10 marks two.

Their golden glow depends on many factors—tree health, local weather shifts, soil moisture and where they grow in terms of elevation and latitude. Healthy aspens are the true stars of the season: strong, thriving groves burst with brighter colours and hold onto their leaves longer, while stressed or weakened trees often fade quickly, offering only a glimpse of their usual brilliance.
