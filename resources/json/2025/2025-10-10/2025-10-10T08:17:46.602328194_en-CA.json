In the 9th century, seafaring Norse Vikings settled here. Centuries later, the powerful MacLeod and MacDonald clans claimed these lands, their castles standing guard over countless battles and alliances.","date":"Oct. 3, 2025","bsTitle":"Mist-bound reveries","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251003_SkyeHeather%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e6e0ab2c4b39aca50bef21b673ba5e78","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SkyeHeather_EN-CA6782703552_tmb.jpg","title":"Glen Brittle, Isle of Skye, Scotland","desc":"Mists curl, waters glimmer and legends linger—welcome to Glen Brittle.

One such gem is the Snake River, which winds through Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, United States. A particularly stunning spot along this river is Oxbow Bend—featured in today's image—where calm waters reflect the towering Teton Range, and wildlife such as moose and bald eagles thrive. On calm days, Mount Moran can be seen reflected on the surface of the water. Here, water flows freely, unbound by concrete or commerce, protected by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The Snake River Headwaters, including Oxbow Bend, joined this Act in 2009, ensuring its reflections remain undisturbed and its rhythms unbroken. At dawn, mist dances over the bend and the mountains blush with the first light. Visitors pause, hushed by nature's poetry. Thanks to this Act, the river's story flows on—untamed, unspoiled, unforgettable.","date":"Oct. 2, 2025","bsTitle":"Wild by law","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251002_OxbowBend%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5bdebd2f8f8e3c004ebe094045efe557","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OxbowBend_EN-CA0110307953_tmb.jpg","title":"Oxbow Bend on the Snake River, Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, United States","desc":"Beyond water, rivers carry life, history and stories.
