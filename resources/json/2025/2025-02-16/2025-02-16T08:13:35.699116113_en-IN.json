Made mostly of Entrada Sandstone, it has the same geological roots as nearby sites like Romana Mesa, its parent peak, and Gunsight Butte, another sandstone summit to the east. Part of the Lake Powell region, Alstrom Point extends southward into the vast waters of the lake, in between Padre Bay and Warm Creek Bay. When the lake is full, Alstrom Point towers nearly 300 metres above the water, offering views of the surrounding canyons. Lake Powell, spanning across Utah and Arizona, attracts around 3 million visitors every year.","date":"Feb 9, 2025","bsTitle":"A point worth pondering","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250208_AlstromPoint%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a4ceabb385b6efb3522ec2718bbb39c6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AlstromPoint_EN-IN8438578560_tmb.jpg","title":"Alstrom Point, Lake Powell, United States","desc":"If you're chasing sunsets and jaw-dropping views, come to Alstrom Point.

Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today's image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains.","date":"Feb 8, 2025","bsTitle":"Frozen in time","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250207_SnowySvaneti%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"dfb677972bc4de4011770170a7109f59","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SnowySvaneti_EN-IN8244607405_tmb.jpg","title":"Medieval towers in Mestia, Upper Svaneti, Georgia","desc":"Winter turns Mestia's medieval towers into icy fortresses.

Far from an outcast, it's the backbone of Scotland's rural life and a true champion of the hills and moors. Interestingly, the Blackface sheep didn't originate in Scotland but south of the Anglo-Scottish border. The breed's history is fascinating, and varieties such as the large-framed Perth and the medium-framed Lanark types are found across the United Kingdom. Its coarse fleece is perfect for making durable products like carpets and tweeds—definitely not your average sweater material. China, Australia, India and Iran are home to some of the largest modern sheep flocks, catering to both domestic demands and international markets for wool and mutton.","date":"Feb 6, 2025","bsTitle":"Baa, baa, black sheep?
