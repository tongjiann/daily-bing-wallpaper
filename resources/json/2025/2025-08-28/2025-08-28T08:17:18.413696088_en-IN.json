Globally, there are around 20 species of wheatears, but in North America, the northern wheatear is the one you're most likely to encounter.","date":"Aug 21, 2025","bsTitle":"Perched and poised","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250820_WheatearBird%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"253a6c4dadff13fc72e29304c38b135a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WheatearBird_EN-IN2858155891_tmb.jpg","title":"Wheatear, Peak District National Park, England","desc":"You don't need to be a bird expert to notice the wheatear darting across open ground.
