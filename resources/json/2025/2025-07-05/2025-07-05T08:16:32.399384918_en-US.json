Fed up with years of harassment, LGBTQIA+ patrons fought back. What followed was six days of unrest—and the start of a movement. Led in part by trans activists like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, the uprising challenged not only police brutality but society's silence. Stonewall wasn't the beginning of queer existence, but it was the moment people said 'no more' loud enough to be heard worldwide. The first Pride marches came the next year, not as parties, but as protests. Thousands marched in New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago to mark the anniversary of Stonewall. Holding signs and chanting for liberation, they demanded visibility, rights, and justice.","date":"Jun 28, 2025","bsTitle":"Flying the flag for Pride","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250628_PrideParade%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a2a03648f7b22550c23369bdab003bc9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PrideParade_EN-US9405333794_tmb.jpg","title":"Pride 2025","desc":"In the early hours of June 28, 1969, a police raid at the Stonewall Inn in New York's Greenwich Village met unexpected resistance.

The splendid leaf frog (aka splendid tree frog) is a rainforest resident with a flair for the dramatic: neon legs, sticky feet, and a disappearing act. One minute it's a humble green leaf, the next it's a flash of color mid-leap, startling predators. This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama, and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. It spends its days snoozing on leaves and its nights foraging for insects. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights.","date":"Jun 27, 2025","bsTitle":"A splendid creature","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250627_SplendidFrog%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f5d317646a0e055ee8cbe88b0e9b19df","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SplendidFrog_EN-US9346105347_tmb.jpg","title":"Splendid leaf frog","desc":"Don't let the name fool you—this frog isn't just leafing around.

Since its humble beginnings in 1970, when tickets cost just one British pound, Glastonbury has grown into a cultural powerhouse, attracting over 200,000 fans each year. The festival is deeply rooted in the ideals of the hippie movement, the 1960s counterculture, and the free festival spirit that sparked its early days. From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young, and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael's Church Tower. The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore.","date":"Jun 25, 2025","bsTitle":"Tor and tunes: Glastonbury begins","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250625_GlastonburyScenic%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"155b6b2f48ad58438aa2e7b800d03025","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GlastonburyScenic_EN-US2433998806_tmb.jpg","title":"Glastonbury Festival begins","desc":"As the sun rises over the hills in Somerset, Glastonbury Festival comes alive, transforming a quiet part of South West England into one of…","hash":"byWjSAAO7wzeWEZYQNbw5kGyOrRXn0ttfGL2A3n92jU="}},{"startdate":"20250624","fullstartdate":"202506240700","enddate":"20250625","url":"/th?id=OHR.DelicateArch_EN-US2369284902_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.DelicateArch_EN-US2369284902","copyright":"Delicate Arch, Arches National Park, Utah (© mmac72/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Delicate+Arch+Arches+National+Park+Utah&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250624_0700%22","title":"Nature took its time","caption":"Delicate Arch, Arches National Park, Utah","copyrightonly":"© mmac72/Getty Images","desc":"This place wasn't built overnight—nature took its time to craft this masterpiece.
