Fed up with years of harassment, LGBTQIA+ patrons fought back. What followed was six days of unrest—and the start of a movement. Led in part by trans activists like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, the uprising challenged not only police brutality but society's silence. Stonewall wasn't the beginning of queer existence, but it was the moment people said 'no more' loud enough to be heard worldwide. Today, Stonewall stands as a symbol of resilience. It reminds us that Pride began with bricks, not branding. So, as rainbow flags wave each June, remember the power of resistance—and that the first Pride was a riot with a cause.","date":"Jun 28, 2025","bsTitle":"The riot that lit the rainbow","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250627_PrideParade%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"735864f49a08a84329acef984334fa96","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PrideParade_EN-IN2010815861_tmb.jpg","title":"Anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising","desc":"In the early hours of June 28, 1969, a police raid at the Stonewall Inn in New York's Greenwich Village met unexpected resistance.

The splendid leaf frog, or splendid treefrog, is a rainforest resident with a flair for the dramatic: neon legs, sticky feet and a disappearing act. One minute it's a humble green leaf, the next it's a flash of colour mid-leap, startling predators. This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, its oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights. Breeding season gets creative. Females lay their eggs on leaves overhanging small pools or puddles. Once the eggs hatch, the tadpoles drop into the water below—no parental supervision required.","date":"Jun 27, 2025","bsTitle":"A splendid life","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250626_SplendidFrog%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"eaebc9ba8641c90fab12c6bed38fcc85","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SplendidFrog_EN-IN1765447694_tmb.jpg","title":"Splendid leaf frog","desc":"Don't let the name fool you—this frog isn't just leafing around.

The festival is deeply rooted in the ideals of the hippie movement, the 1960s counterculture and the free festival spirit that sparked its early days. From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael's Church Tower.
