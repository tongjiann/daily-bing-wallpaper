The splendid leaf frog, or splendid treefrog, is a rainforest resident with a flair for the dramatic: neon legs, sticky feet and a disappearing act. One minute it's a humble green leaf, the next it's a flash of colour mid-leap, startling predators. This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. This amphibian is a nocturnal ninja, spending its days snoozing on leaves and its nights foraging for insects. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, its oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights.","date":"Jun. 27, 2025","bsTitle":"A splendid life","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250627_SplendidFrog%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ce965d677530c8ae68243c382757a448","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SplendidFrog_EN-CA1521456248_tmb.jpg","title":"Splendid leaf frog","desc":"Don't let the name fool you—this frog isn't just leafing around.

The festival is deeply rooted in the ideals of the hippie movement, the 1960s counterculture and the free festival spirit that sparked its early days. From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael's Church Tower. The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore.","date":"Jun. 25, 2025","bsTitle":"Tor and tunes: Glastonbury begins","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250625_GlastonburyScenic%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"eb65f2922fa42289ee330397f25f57b6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GlastonburyScenic_EN-CA0680110698_tmb.jpg","title":"Glastonbury Festival begins","desc":"As the sun rises over the hills in Somerset, Glastonbury Festival comes alive, transforming a quiet part of South West England into one of…","hash":"byWjSAAO7wzeWEZYQNbw5kGyOrRXn0ttfGL2A3n92jU="}},{"startdate":"20250624","fullstartdate":"202506240400","enddate":"20250625","url":"/th?id=OHR.DelicateArch_EN-CA0482409056_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.DelicateArch_EN-CA0482409056","copyright":"Delicate Arch, Arches National Park, Utah (© mmac72/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Delicate+Arch+Arches+National+Park+Utah&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250624_0400%22","title":"Nature took its time","caption":"Delicate Arch, Arches National Park, Utah, United States","copyrightonly":"© mmac72/Getty Images","desc":"This place wasn't built overnight—nature took its time to craft this masterpiece.
