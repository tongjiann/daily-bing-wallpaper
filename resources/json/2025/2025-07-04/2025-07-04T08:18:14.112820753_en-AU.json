This enchanting locale blends mountainous charm with pristine coastal beauty—the nearby Gulf of Orosei and the Gennargentu massif form a protected regional park.","date":"4 Jul 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250704_OroseiSardegna%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"684c48ea68dc6c810d6f1b53a952498c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OroseiSardegna_ROW4878996208_tmb.jpg","title":"Orosei, Sardinia, Italy","desc":"We are in Cala Luna, a jewel in the crown of the Gulf of Orosei in eastern Sardinia, Italy, on the Tyrrhenian Sea.
