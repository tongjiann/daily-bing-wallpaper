Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains.","date":"Feb. 8, 2025","bsTitle":"Frozen in time","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250208_SnowySvaneti%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c5cad56037b72eaaa3c12326951bbdac","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SnowySvaneti_EN-CA8293251402_tmb.jpg","title":"Medieval towers in Mestia, Upper Svaneti, Georgia","desc":"Winter turns Mestia's medieval towers into icy fortresses.

Legend has it that if he emerges from his burrow on February 2 and sees his own shadow, Canadians brace for an extended winter; no shadow means an early spring is on the way. Though it is celebrated mostly in Ontario, other places like Nova Scotia and Quebec also take part in the fun. The tradition has deep roots, first appearing in the early 1800s when European settlers brought similar customs to North America.
