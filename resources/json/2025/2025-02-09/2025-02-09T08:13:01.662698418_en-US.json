Today, Americans and Canadians rely on the prognostication skills of Punxsutawney Phil to determine if winter will hang on. Phil is a famous groundhog, also known as a woodchuck, and legend has it that if he emerges from his burrow February 2 and sees his own shadow, he'll go back to sleep for another six weeks of winter. If he doesn't, it will be an early spring. German immigrants brought the custom to America, where it was first celebrated in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, in 1887. Historically, Europeans celebrated February 2 as the first day of spring, and Germans originally watched badgers and other small animals for signs of seasonal change important to farmers. The Germans who settled in Pennsylvania in the 18th and 19th centuries chose the area's native groundhog for this task.","date":"Feb 2, 2025","bsTitle":"Weather or not","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250202_AustriaMarmot%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ea8e5425b0373a07aa6572f189d09d25","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AustriaMarmot_EN-US0012248153_tmb.jpg","title":"Groundhog Day","desc":"It's Groundhog Day … again.

The weeklong celebration was observed in the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and African American abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Its popularity grew over the next 50 years in large part because of the civil rights movement, and President Gerald Ford expanded it to a full month in 1976. Other countries honor their own Black histories, including Canada, which also celebrates Black History Month throughout February.","date":"Feb 1, 2025","bsTitle":"Roots of freedom","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250201_AfricanMuseumDC%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"b8d20e265d6b3352531ebfee57e451ad","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AfricanMuseumDC_EN-US9749048351_tmb.jpg","title":"Black History Month","desc":"Today, the United States begins an annual, monthlong celebration of African Americans and their contributions to the country's history and…","hash":"81/mbp2XmOThiT2N8NDxC1IBuFz75LjpH2OiNRAaxCs="}},{"startdate":"20250131","fullstartdate":"202501310800","enddate":"20250201","url":"/th?id=OHR.PlainsZebra_EN-US9488790690_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.PlainsZebra_EN-US9488790690","copyright":"Plains zebras at sunrise, Mokala National Park, South Africa (© EcoPrint/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Plains+Zebra&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250131_0800%22","title":"Anything but plain","caption":"Happy International Zebra Day!","copyrightonly":"© EcoPrint/Shutterstock","desc":"Celebrate the beauty of zebras on International Zebra Day!
