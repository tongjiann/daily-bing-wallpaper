The alpine marmot is native to central and southern Europe and can be found at altitudes between 800 and 3,200 metres. Weighing between 1.9 to 7 kilograms, they are easily recognised by their round faces, short tails and dense fur that helps them endure chilly mountain climates. When it comes to food, these creatures are herbivores with simple taste. These little champs spend their summer days grazing on grasses, herbs, roots, seeds and flowers, storing up energy for their big event: a roughly nine-month hibernation party. Sometimes they eat grain, worms, insects and spiders. Beyond their hibernation habits, alpine marmots live a highly social lifestyle. They communicate through a variety of vocal sounds, including sharp whistles to warn the group of predators like eagles or foxes. This strong sense of community is key to their survival.","date":"2 Feb 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250202_AustriaMarmot%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9bb17f1349c9c2bfa8c0e72cdec09a1c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AustriaMarmot_ROW5065461814_tmb.jpg","title":"Alpine marmot","desc":"The alpine marmot in today's image is a close relative of the groundhog, which is another species of marmot.

In the 16th century, the castle underwent significant expansion to become a Saxon state fortress, with the start of construction of the imposing 152.5-metre-deep castle well between 1566 and 1569 being an important milestone.

Grass is their main dish, but they'll munch on leaves and barks if that's what's on the menu. They have a tough digestive system that lets them make the most of whatever they find, even if it's not the freshest. Plains zebras live in family groups, usually led by a dominant stallion, with mares and their foals forming the core of the herd.","date":"31 Jan 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250131_PlainsZebra%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7b498dff35f2343adf1bed98fe0c8dd4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PlainsZebra_ROW4908645936_tmb.jpg","title":"Plains zebras, South Africa","desc":"In today's picture, we see two plains zebras—which are anything but plain—standing gracefully at sunrise in Mokala National Park, South…","hash":"t8cawro7BtUlKerfQWh7+/jUxGrx1d8jaWFxkQfAOyU="}},{"startdate":"20250130","fullstartdate":"202501300800","enddate":"20250131","url":"/th?id=OHR.OrdesaSpain_ROW4837381586_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.OrdesaSpain_ROW4837381586","copyright":"Roland's Breach, Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park, Spain (© Inaki Relanzon/Nature Picture Library/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Rolands+Breach&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250130_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Roland's Breach, Spain","copyrightonly":"© Inaki Relanzon/Nature Picture Library/Alamy Stock Photo","desc":"High up in the Pyrenees, there is a gap in the mountains.
