Its design features three naves, divided by two rows of 12 columns each. Featured in today's image is the basilica's real showstopper: the basement crypt or a burial chamber is a stunning model of early religious design. Complete with vaulted ceilings that slope down into rows of stone columns, its floor is a work of art itself. It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time.","date":"Jan. 6, 2025","bsTitle":"Divine depths","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250106_RavennaBasilica%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ed4ec0557bbd0f47ff6fae50689092a5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RavennaBasilica_EN-CA7555362704_tmb.jpg","title":"Flooded crypt, Basilica of San Francesco, Ravenna, Italy","desc":"In the Italian province of Ravenna lies the Basilica of San Francesco, recognised for its beauty and historical significance.

Native to the Indian subcontinent, these birds are known for their swift, acrobatic flight and distinctive calls that echo through the air. These calls help them stay connected while foraging or alerting the flock to nearby threats. Breeding starts around February, peaking by April to June. These birds are cavity nesters, often using hollowed-out tree trunks to lay their eggs. Both parents play a role in feeding and protecting the chicks. If you ever meet them, be mindful of your words because they are sneaky mimics and might just pick up a word or two.","date":"Jan. 5, 2025","bsTitle":"Head-turner on the treetops","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250105_PlumParakeet%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8f054875032b50b4d125a643ff0c56f6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PlumParakeet_EN-CA7233766984_tmb.jpg","title":"Plum-headed parakeet","desc":"Look up at the skies and experience the magic of birds.
