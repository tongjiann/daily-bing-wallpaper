In Wales, the clocks turn back—figuratively—to celebrate Hen Galan, or the 'Old New Year,' on January 13. As part of this tradition, Calennig, meaning 'New Year's gift' in Welsh, plays a central role, linking the celebration to customs from the Julian calendar era. Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs, and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food, or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples. These aren't for snacking, though; they're miniature symbols of luck and prosperity.","date":"Jan 13, 2025","bsTitle":"'Welsh' you a Happy Hen Galan!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250113_CoastalWales%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1aa9deab4d5fa771b915e211b6ba7c78","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CoastalWales_EN-US9397534673_tmb.jpg","title":"Happy Welsh New Year!","desc":"Who says New Year's Day has to be on January 1?
