They're plankton-eating giants with no interest in humans. Found in warm waters from the Maldives and Mozambique to Mexico's Yucatán coast, they often show up in food-rich, calm waters. Their mouths can stretch over a metre wide, but they feed by suction, not biting. Each has a unique pattern of white spots and stripes—no two alike—used by researchers to track individuals. Their breeding patterns remain largely a mystery, but they are ovoviviparous, meaning pups hatch inside the mother before being born alive. Their story reminds us how much ocean life remains a mystery and how vital it is to protect what we already know is at risk.","date":"30 Aug 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250830_MaldivesWhaleShark%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ad36cb2561d47c866cc3f8b17888e014","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MaldivesWhaleShark_ROW7272953722_tmb.jpg","title":"Whale shark","desc":"Whale sharks are the biggest fish in the sea, but don't let the word 'shark' fool you.

These are whitewashed stone houses topped with dry-stacked limestone roofs shaped like upside-down ice cream cones. It's an ancient building technique and in this case, a clever one.

Along the basalt cliffs, white mineral deposits that gave Calcite Springs its name are visible, formed by mineral-rich waters still steaming from underground.
