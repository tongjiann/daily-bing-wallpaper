Today is International Whale Shark Day, a reminder that these slow-motion giants need our attention. First observed in 2008, the day is used by researchers and marine advocates to spotlight conservation efforts and threats like vessel strikes, plastic pollution and unregulated tourism. Whale sharks are the biggest fish in the sea, but don't let the word 'shark' fool you. They're plankton-eating giants with no interest in humans. Found in warm waters from the Maldives and Mozambique to Mexico's Yucatán coast, they often show up in food-rich, calm waters. Their mouths can stretch over a metre wide, but they feed by suction, not biting.","date":"Aug 30, 2025","bsTitle":"Finned and fabulous","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250829_MaldivesWhaleShark%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ec79c61121b4b782ac1ffc1a7f0ac36f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MaldivesWhaleShark_EN-IN3643535243_tmb.jpg","title":"International Whale Shark Day","desc":"If you've never seen an over- 10-metre, polka-dotted fish gliding past coral reefs, you are missing out.

Fish are their main prey, but they also eat frogs, reptiles and even small mammals. In the late 1800s, the great egret's beautiful plumes became a must-have in women's fashion across North America, driving their population down by an estimated 95%. The killing might have continued if not for two Boston socialites, Harriet Hemenway and Minna Hall, who led a boycott of the feather trade.
