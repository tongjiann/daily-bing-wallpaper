The Everglades is not a typical swamp or river. It is a slow, shallow sheet of water that drifts south across flat grasslands toward Florida Bay, linking forests, marshes, mangroves and coastal prairies. This subtropical wilderness supports hundreds of species, including alligators, manatees and the endangered Florida panther. On December 6, 1947, the United States established the Everglades National Park, protecting over 600,000 hectares and shifting conservation toward preserving entire ecosystems rather than isolated landmarks.","date":"6 Dec 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251206_EvergladesSunrise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7af704282fa13b9ff9529f7a9c740be3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EvergladesSunrise_ROW6583902193_tmb.jpg","title":"Everglades National Park, Florida","desc":"On Florida's southern tip lies one of the United States' most unusual landscapes.

It is a wilderness where caribou, Dall sheep and grizzly bears roam free and glaciers carve valleys that have existed for millennia. The park is a realm of extremes: its glaciers sprawling like frozen rivers, volcanic peaks piercing the sky. Among them stands Mount Blackburn, a 5,000-metre sentinel of ice and ancient fire. Its snow-mantled slopes feed vast glacier systems, a silent monument to geological time. Just beyond the park boundary, Willow Lake rests in the Copper River Basin—a roadside jewel along the Richardson Highway. On clear days, its glassy surface reflects the Wrangell Mountains in a panorama that feels endless: Blackburn's white shoulders rising against cobalt skies, mirrored in still waters where swans drift like living brushstrokes.","date":"2 Dec 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251202_WillowLake%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"79750dc087c2a066ebd0ec5a24a08487","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WillowLake_ROW6069143746_tmb.jpg","title":"Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, United States","desc":"Spanning over 53,000 square kilometres, Wrangell–St. Elias, in Alaska, is the largest national park in the United States.

Today, with its cultural and culinary offerings spread across the historic old town and about 300 stalls, it is one of the largest Christmas markets in Germany. Imagine streets buzzing with the chatter of traders and children following the scent of 'Lebkuchen'—honey-sweetened cakes.
