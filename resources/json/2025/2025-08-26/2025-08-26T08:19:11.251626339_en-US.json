These are whitewashed stone houses topped with dry-stacked limestone roofs shaped like upside-down ice cream cones. It's an ancient building technique, and in this case, a clever one. Back in the 14th century, locals were reportedly trying to avoid property taxes by constructing homes that could be quickly dismantled when the king's tax collector came around.","date":"Aug 26, 2025","bsTitle":"A 'trulli' remarkable town","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250826_TrulliHouses%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e7231458ee5cef7bedba833f4130963d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TrulliHouses_EN-US3489439665_tmb.jpg","title":"Trullo buildings in Alberobello, Apulia, Italy","desc":"If fairy tales had architects, they might've come up with something like Alberobello in Italy.

The northern wheatear weighs less than an ounce, but travels thousands of miles between its summer homes in Alaska and northern Canada to its wintering grounds in Africa. Its migration route is one of the longest for a bird its size. Unlike many backyard songbirds, wheatears prefer wide-open spaces with low vegetation, where they can sprint and pounce on insects.

Bonifacio is divided into two sections, with the 'vieille ville' (old town)—also known as 'la Haute Ville' (the Upper City)—standing on a high cliff within the original citadel walls.
