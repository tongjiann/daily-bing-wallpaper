Bonifacio didn't begin as a picturesque tourist destination—it was originally established as a coastal fortification and has spent centuries guarding one of the Mediterranean's busiest sea lanes. Established in 828 CE by Boniface II of Tuscany, the commune gradually became a meeting point for traders, soldiers, and sailors—each group contributing to the evolution of the town's structure. Bonifacio is divided into two sections, with the 'vieille ville' (old town)—also known as 'la Haute Ville' (the Upper City)—standing on a high cliff within the original citadel walls. Below, the marine area lines the narrow inlet with harbors, waterfront homes, and a growing valley community.","date":"Aug 20, 2025","bsTitle":"Built to last","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250820_CitadelBonifacio%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"13a624c108c2547545964ccb5819c67c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CitadelBonifacio_EN-US2046177235_tmb.jpg","title":"The citadel in Bonifacio, Southern Corsica, France","desc":"Set at Corsica's southern edge, Bonifacio looks out across a narrow strait to Sardinia, its limestone cliffs towering above the waves…","hash":"MGQvaMm6gvr70GFIZ5lb4nK4cr301F6TxABXAacd8hA="}},{"startdate":"20250819","fullstartdate":"202508190700","enddate":"20250820","url":"/th?id=OHR.SolarAviation_EN-US1940905760_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.SolarAviation_EN-US1940905760","copyright":"Solar Impulse 2 at Kalaeloa Airport, Honolulu, Hawaii (© Solar Impulse/Revillard/Sipa/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=National+Aviation+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250819_0700%22","title":"Powered by the sun","caption":"Solar Impulse 2 in Honolulu","copyrightonly":"© Solar Impulse/Revillard/Sipa/Shutterstock","desc":"Planes, progress, and a whole lot of sky.

Tucked away in New York's Adirondack High Peaks, this 9-acre alpine lake sits at nearly 2,900 feet between Mount Colden and Avalanche Mountain. Shaped by ancient glaciers, the lake is framed by dramatic cliffs and rugged terrain that echo its icy origins. Its most striking feature is the Trap Dike—a towering 1,200-foot rock canyon flanked by steep walls, making the lake one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the Adirondacks. Massive avalanches carved these cliffs, leaving behind the dramatic landscape that gave Avalanche Lake its name. The Avalanche Lake Trail begins at the Adirondack Loj, a well-known launch point for adventures in the High Peaks.
