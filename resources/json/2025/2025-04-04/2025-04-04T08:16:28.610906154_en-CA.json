Legend has it that an emperor's former wife transformed into a tigress out of devotion and carried Guru Padmasambhava from Tibet to Taktsang in Bhutan. There, he meditated in a cave and is believed to have emerged in eight incarnations, giving the monastery its name—the 'Tiger's Nest.'","date":"Apr. 4, 2025","bsTitle":"Cliffside calm, spiritual charm","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250404_BhutanMonastery%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"512dde651a231d456e5bcce229add9b9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BhutanMonastery_EN-CA6496050057_tmb.jpg","title":"Taktsang Palphug Monastery, Bhutan","desc":"Today's image takes us to Taktsang Palphug, or the Tiger's Nest—a Buddhist monastery perched 3,000 metres above sea level in Bhutan.

Rufous hummingbirds don't just fly—they dart, hover and zip through gardens like tiny, feathered rockets. They migrate thousands of kilometres from Mexico to the Pacific Northwest, making one of the longest migratory journeys relative to body size. The males arrive first, flashing their signature coppery-orange feathers to claim territory. They perform dramatic aerial dives to impress potential mates, reaching speeds of nearly 80 kilometres per hour. With wings beating up to 42 to 62 times per second based on gender, they burn energy fast, making frequent pit stops at flowers and feeders to fuel up. Once the display is over, the female gets to work, building a soft, camouflaged nest in trees or shrubs, where she raises the tiny chicks on her own.","date":"Apr. 3, 2025","bsTitle":"Nectar stopover","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250403_RufousHummingbird%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ed29f9489f59abe013d08cd82a06910a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RufousHummingbird_EN-CA2493433576_tmb.jpg","title":"Rufous hummingbird","desc":"Blink, and you miss them.
