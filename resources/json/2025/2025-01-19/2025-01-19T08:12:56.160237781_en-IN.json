The entire cave complex stretches on for around 4 kilometres, although visitors can only access about 300 metres of the total. Inside, there's a labyrinth of lit pathways winding past stalactite and stalagmite formations, leading to an over 100-metres-long saltwater lake.","date":"Jan 19, 2025","bsTitle":"A grotto fit for a god","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250118_NeptunesGrotto%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1ab58abaf75a99a526929b8577f583f4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NeptunesGrotto_EN-IN4839715567_tmb.jpg","title":"Neptune's Grotto, Sardinia, Italy","desc":"Down 654 steps, perched perilously over the sea in Sardinia, Italy, you'll find a surprise waiting for you.

Although it's the smallest of the eight pelican species worldwide, it's still a large bird, measuring about 1.2 metres in length and having a wingspan of over 1.5 metres. The brown pelican is a piscivore, meaning its diet mainly consists of fish. Dixon Lanier Merritt's limerick famously begins, 'A wonderful bird is the pelican; his bill can hold more than his belly can,' and it's spot on—its pouch can store up to three times the volume of its stomach. This versatile feature acts as a scoop, a tool for cooling off during hot weather and a feeding trough for young pelicans. The brown pelican faced near extinction twice, first due to hunting and later from the impact of pesticides like DDT. Today, it's an Endangered Species Act and Environmental Protection Agency success story.","date":"Jan 17, 2025","bsTitle":"Pouch perfect","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250116_PelicanPortrait%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"be34681c8fae51e8222db9c312dcbbd2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PelicanPortrait_EN-IN4347458454_tmb.jpg","title":"Brown pelican, San Diego, California, United States","desc":"Today's image features the brown pelican, a bird that doesn't just fly but soars, spots and dives with unmatched precision.

This land owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago.
