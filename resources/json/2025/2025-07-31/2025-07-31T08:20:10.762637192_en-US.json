But when a baby ring-tailed lemur wraps its tail around or gives it a tug, it's actually working on crucial skills. The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly, and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom, and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination, and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings, and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama.","date":"Jul 31, 2025","bsTitle":"Madagascar native","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250731_BabyLemur%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3f5fd5a29c6cfc24002dbbccd082cb20","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BabyLemur_EN-US9264861498_tmb.jpg","title":"Ring-tailed lemur","desc":"It looks like this small creature is playing a game, right?

That's exactly what artist Saype had in mind with 'Beyond Walls,' a series of massive, biodegradable land-art murals featuring interlinked hands. Symbolizing unity and solidarity, these works have stretched across five continents. At Expo 2020 Dubai, Saype's 11th installation covered over 16,000 square feet of grass in Al Forsan Park. It formed a striking black-and-white handshake that could only be fully appreciated from above, as seen here.
