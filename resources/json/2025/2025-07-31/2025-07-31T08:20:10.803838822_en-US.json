Today is a good time to appreciate those childhood partners in crime who made growing up way more exciting. Cousins often land somewhere between sibling and friend, getting into trouble with you, sharing inside jokes, and showing up at every family gathering. In nature, few creatures mirror that kind of togetherness better than the ashy woodswallow, pictured here. Native to South Asia, these birds are rarely seen alone. They gather in tight groups on bare branches or perch atop high places like powerlines. From there, they launch into graceful flights—flapping and gliding as they snatch insects midair.","date":"Jul 24, 2025","bsTitle":"Sticking together","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250724_AshyWoodswallow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6397c646999e2343a9511a9167f2c026","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AshyWoodswallow_EN-US7005770998_tmb.jpg","title":"Happy Cousins Day!","desc":"Remember the cousin who convinced you to climb the tallest tree or the one who helped you sneak an extra slice of cake at the family reunion…","hash":"LopuUFLtJ9qmToUhPdx9X2/NtXhoXGwCw0gR6G8++MQ="}},{"startdate":"20250723","fullstartdate":"202507230700","enddate":"20250724","url":"/th?id=OHR.VaticanCity_EN-US5915643866_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.VaticanCity_EN-US5915643866","copyright":"Vatican City with St. Peter's Basilica (© RudyBalasko/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Vatican+City&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250723_0700%22","title":"A country within a city","caption":"Vatican City with St. Peter's Basilica","copyrightonly":"© RudyBalasko/Getty Images","desc":"In the middle of Rome, Italy, lies an entire country of its own: Vatican City.

Seen in the distance in today's image, this Renaissance masterpiece is built over what is believed to be the tomb of St. Peter, the first bishop of Rome. With its soaring dome dominating the skyline, the basilica is one of the largest churches in the world. Just beyond the basilica lies St. Peter's Square, where thousands gather for papal blessings. The Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel, which houses Michelangelo's famed ceiling, are other must-sees. Despite its size, Vatican City has its own postal service, telephone system, and banking system.","date":"Jul 23, 2025","bsTitle":"A country within a city","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250723_VaticanCity%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3f8abc11072c2ca03c49299b29f92621","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VaticanCity_EN-US5915643866_tmb.jpg","title":"Vatican City with St. Peter's Basilica","desc":"In the middle of Rome, Italy, lies an entire country of its own: Vatican City.

Spanning over 379 square miles, the park is divided into three main units: the North Unit, home to the visitor center and scenic Badlands Loop Road; and the Stronghold and Palmer Creek units. The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about one inch per year, revealing colorful bands of volcanic ash, silt, and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels, and saber-toothed cats.","date":"Jul 22, 2025","bsTitle":"Epic sunsets and ancient secrets","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250722_BadlandsSunset%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a0981af31affaab560afa8f4c651f208","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BadlandsSunset_EN-US5821746223_tmb.jpg","title":"Badlands National Park in South Dakota","desc":"As the sun sets over Badlands National Park, the landscape transforms into a stunning display of color.
