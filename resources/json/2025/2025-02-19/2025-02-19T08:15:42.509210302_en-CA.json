As an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, his theory of natural selection revolutionised our understanding of species, evolution and our role in the natural world. His work, 'On the Origin of Species,' published in 1859, laid the foundation for modern evolutionary biology. This day marks the birthday of Darwin and honours his genius while promoting curiosity, science and critical thinking. From thought-provoking talks to engaging exhibits, this day motivates us to keep exploring.","date":"Feb. 12, 2025","bsTitle":"Darwin's blueprint","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250212_GalapagosIguana%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6b0273a90d30429037aacae0a8ca4eb5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GalapagosIguana_EN-CA9835077586_tmb.jpg","title":"Celebrating Charles Darwin","desc":"Today, we celebrate Darwin Day—a shout-out to Charles Darwin and his game-changing ideas about life on Earth.

Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency.
