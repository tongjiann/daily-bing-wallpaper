The highlight is the massive Buddha in Cave 5, which is over 15 metres tall. But don't stop there—each cave offers something unique. Some are like ancient storyboards, depicting tales from Buddhist scriptures, while others showcase detailed carvings of monks, deities, musicians and even scenes of daily life under Wei rule. Caves 16–20, known as the 'Tanyao Five Caves,' were the first to be carved at Yungang, overseen by the monk Tanyao.

Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency.
