Found across Europe, Asia and parts of northern Africa, these otters thrive in clean rivers, lakes and wetlands, serving as an important indicator of environmental health. These semi-aquatic animals are built for agility, with streamlined bodies, webbed feet and dense fur that keeps them warm even in icy waters. A single square centimetre of their fur can hold more than 70,000 hairs, making it one of nature's most effective insulators. River otters were once endangered due to pollution and habitat loss. Yet, thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe.","date":"Feb 19, 2025","bsTitle":"The 'otter' side of life","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250218_IceHoleOtter%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ff72ada0d5d9f908978ed076c666959c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.IceHoleOtter_EN-IN0694843542_tmb.jpg","title":"European river otter","desc":"The European river otter, pictured here, is more than just an adorable face in the wild.
