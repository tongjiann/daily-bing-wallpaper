Shaped by the relentless forces of wind and water, this monument features three magnificent natural bridges—Sipapu, Kachina and Owachomo. These bridges were named to honour the Ancestral Puebloans who once lived here. Sipapu is the largest bridge, with a massive opening that could almost fit the dome of the United States Capitol. Kachina, pictured here, is equidistant from Sipapu and Owachomo. It was named after the petroglyphs and pictographs found at its base. Owachomo is believed to be the oldest of the three. Its thin, arching structure suggests it may eventually collapse.","date":"Apr 16, 2025","bsTitle":"A passage through time","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250415_KachinaBridge%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"01204e86f9a52ec767538f9846adf223","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KachinaBridge_EN-IN8735275886_tmb.jpg","title":"Natural Bridges National Monument, Utah, United States","desc":"Within the remote canyons of southeastern Utah, United States, Natural Bridges National Monument highlights the power of erosion and the…","hash":"kyQZSWtvXfOHTbi43R9USH3uGuasWoyIn98YGMXcHxw="}},{"startdate":"20250414","fullstartdate":"202504141830","enddate":"20250415","url":"/th?id=OHR.BeachArt_EN-IN5781333917_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.BeachArt_EN-IN5781333917","copyright":"Beach art on Sauveterre Beach by Zarpo, Les Sables-d'Olonne, Vendee, France (© Hemis/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=World+Art+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250414_1830%22","title":"See Art, Do Art, Be Art","caption":"World Art Day","copyrightonly":"© Hemis/Alamy Stock Photo","desc":"Imagine a world without colour, music or design—how dull would life be?

During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Those seeking a calmer way to celebrate might consider visiting Wat Tang Sai Temple in Ban Krut, seen in today's image. Perched on Thong Chai Mountain, this temple complex is home to an over 10-metre-tall Buddha statue and Thai-style pagodas. Built in 1996 to honour King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) on his 50th year of reign (1946–2016), it remains an important spiritual site. With stunning coastline views, Wat Tang Sai offers a peaceful setting to meditate and feel the vibrations of Buddhist chants.","date":"Apr 13, 2025","bsTitle":"Let's celebrate Songkran!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250412_ThailandPagodas%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"83964a9ebec103e3ee5bed0a4de71ea8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ThailandPagodas_EN-IN4796043507_tmb.jpg","title":"Songkran—Thai New Year","desc":"New Year celebrations don't always come with fireworks—sometimes, they come with buckets and a nationwide water splash fest!
