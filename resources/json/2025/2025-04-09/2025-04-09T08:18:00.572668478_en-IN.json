Take the Atlantic spotted dolphin—featured here—known for the spots on its body, which multiply and become denser with age. They are highly social creatures, often forming dynamic groups of 5–15 individuals, sometimes mingling with common bottlenose dolphins. Known for their speed and agility, they frequently engage in bow-riding and perform long, shallow leaps across the water. These dolphins are also skilled nocturnal hunters, working together to corral their prey—primarily small fish, benthic invertebrates and squid. When confronting other species, they tend to use physical tactics like biting and chasing, whereas within their own groups, they rely more on visual displays to assert dominance.","date":"Apr 6, 2025","bsTitle":"The chase begins!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250405_SpottedDolphins%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"923edcc5119d13db29436ffc7e9b224e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpottedDolphins_EN-IN9911189149_tmb.jpg","title":"Dolphins near Santa Maria Island, Azores, Portugal","desc":"Today we are highlighting dolphins, some of the smartest and most fascinating marine mammals.
