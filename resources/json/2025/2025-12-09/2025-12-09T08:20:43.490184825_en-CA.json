Whistler, in British Columbia, lets you try both in the same day. This resort municipality sits about 125 kilometres north of Vancouver in the Coast Mountains, with two main ski peaks: Whistler and Blackcomb. These are linked by the PEAK 2 PEAK Gondola, famous for giving a suspended, panoramic valley view in just a few minutes of travel. The area gained fame when it co-hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics, and some of those venues are still open to the public today. The name 'Whistler' comes from the high-pitched call of the local hoary marmots that were once common around the slopes.","date":"Dec. 2, 2025","bsTitle":"Winter at Whistler","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251202_WhistlerVillage%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"992087b20da4c8554cec2676b2818ffd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WhistlerVillage_EN-CA2405537581_tmb.jpg","title":"Whistler, British Columbia","desc":"What's your winter personality: cosy wanderer or slope-chaser?

Today, with its cultural and culinary offerings spread across the historic old town and about 300 stalls, it is one of the largest Christmas markets in Germany. Imagine streets buzzing with the chatter of traders and children following the scent of 'Lebkuchen'—honey-sweetened cakes.
