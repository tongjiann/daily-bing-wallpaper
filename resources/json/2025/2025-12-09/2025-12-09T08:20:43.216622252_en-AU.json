Found mainly in Argentina, Chile, Peru and Bolivia, they're built for life at high altitude. Their thick coats help them handle chilly winds, while their padded feet give them the grip to trek across rocky terrain that would make even mountain goats nervous.","date":"9 Dec 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251209_LlamaDay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"96f1d453663d88209bd15f2f4d157c56","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LlamaDay_ROW4693372268_tmb.jpg","title":"Guanaco, Argentina","desc":"If llamas are the laid-back stars of the Andes, their cousins, the guanacos, are the free spirits of Patagonia.

Its snow-mantled slopes feed vast glacier systems, a silent monument to geological time. Just beyond the park boundary, Willow Lake rests in the Copper River Basin—a roadside jewel along the Richardson Highway.
