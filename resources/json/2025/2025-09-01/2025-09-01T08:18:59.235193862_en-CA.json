These seabirds are high-speed hunters. Spotting fish from 70 metres up, they fold their wings and dive at speeds nearing 100 km/h. Air sacs in the skull protect them from the force of impact, allowing them to grab prey like herring, capelin and sand lance underwater with accuracy.","date":"Aug. 25, 2025","bsTitle":"Wings wide open","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250825_Gannets%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"144c0b90f40cc2ae5e9ac05b5159ec33","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Gannets_EN-CA1938110347_tmb.jpg","title":"Colony of northern gannets in Quebec","desc":"They are easy to recognise: sleek white bodies, black wingtips and a dagger-sharp bill.

Bonifacio is divided into two sections, with the 'vieille ville' (old town)—also known as 'la Haute Ville' (the Upper City)—standing on a high cliff within the original citadel walls.
