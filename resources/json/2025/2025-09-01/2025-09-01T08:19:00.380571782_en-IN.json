This spot, known as Calcite Springs Overlook, is where nature puts on a spectacular show—steaming vents, rugged cliffs and the ribbon of the river carving through the canyon tell stories millions of years in the making. This thermal-meets-canyon overlook offers front-row views of the Yellowstone River carving its way through a lava-forged canyon. Along the basalt cliffs, white mineral deposits that gave Calcite Springs its name are visible, formed by mineral-rich waters still steaming from underground. You might spot a bald eagle gliding overhead or bison lounging nearby. Yellowstone is more than just a park—it's a supervolcano with a visitor centre.","date":"Aug 25, 2025","bsTitle":"From volcanic roots to river routes","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250824_YellowstoneRiver%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"62d27d529d24ab9339ebde03b5463d83","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YellowstoneRiver_EN-IN1865488770_tmb.jpg","title":"Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States","desc":"Today, we are in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, United States.

Originally envisioned on a much grander scale—twice its current size—the cathedral's fate was tied to the fortunes of the silver mines.
