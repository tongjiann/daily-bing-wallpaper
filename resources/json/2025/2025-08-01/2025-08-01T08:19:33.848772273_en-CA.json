This vibrant city is one of the capitals and the most populous city in the Canary Islands, an archipelago belonging to Spain. Located on the northeastern coast of the island of Gran Canaria, Las Palmas is home to over 380,000 people and serves as a major port and commercial hub in the Atlantic. The city's distinctive palette of painted buildings—seen here from above—adds striking colour to neighbourhoods like Risco de San Juan, where homes are built into the hillsides. Founded in 1478, Las Palmas has a layered history shaped by Spanish colonisation, maritime trade and migration. Today, it is known for its subtropical desert climate—with average temperatures ranging from 15°C in winter to 27°C in summer—and for Las Canteras Beach, one of the best urban beaches in Europe.","date":"Jul. 25, 2025","bsTitle":"Canvas of life","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250725_LasPalmas%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2f9078c368d231bcb3d7560f998012d4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LasPalmas_EN-CA3268304328_tmb.jpg","title":"Colourful houses of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain","desc":"If you're eager to explore faraway landscapes this summer, let us take you to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.

Today is a good time to appreciate those childhood partners in crime who made growing up way more exciting. Cousins often land somewhere between sibling and friend, getting into trouble with you, sharing inside jokes and showing up at every family gathering. The bond may stretch over time and distance, but it seldom fades. In nature, few creatures mirror that kind of togetherness better than the ashy woodswallow, pictured here. Native to South Asia, these birds are rarely seen alone. They gather in tight groups on bare branches or perch atop high places like powerlines. From there, they launch into graceful flights—flapping and gliding as they snatch insects midair.","date":"Jul. 24, 2025","bsTitle":"Birds of a feather stick together","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250724_AshyWoodswallow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d9d410c4a6f80aaca0c1a7bc64a5b887","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AshyWoodswallow_EN-CA5890367905_tmb.jpg","title":"Happy Cousins Day!","desc":"Remember the cousin who convinced you to climb the tallest tree or the one who helped you sneak an extra slice of cake at the family reunion…","hash":"LopuUFLtJ9qmToUhPdx9X2/NtXhoXGwCw0gR6G8++MQ="}},{"startdate":"20250723","fullstartdate":"202507230400","enddate":"20250724","url":"/th?id=OHR.VaticanCity_EN-CA5754198361_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.VaticanCity_EN-CA5754198361","copyright":"Vatican City with Saint Peter's Basilica, Rome, Italy (© RudyBalasko/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Vatican+City&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250723_0400%22","title":"A country within a city","caption":"Vatican City, Rome, Italy","copyrightonly":"© RudyBalasko/Getty Images","desc":"In the middle of Rome, Italy, lies an entire country of its own: Vatican City.

Spanning over 980 square kilometres, the park is divided into three main units: the North Unit, home to the visitor centre and scenic Badlands Loop Road; and the Stronghold and Palmer Creek units. The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of 2 centimetres per year, revealing colourful bands of volcanic ash, silt and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels and sabre-toothed cats.","date":"Jul. 22, 2025","bsTitle":"Epic sunsets and ancient secrets","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250722_BadlandsSunset%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3d2e876cec80c2a90a0dc6bdc95fb497","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BadlandsSunset_EN-CA5588224292_tmb.jpg","title":"Badlands National Park, South Dakota, United States","desc":"As the sun sets over Badlands National Park, the landscape transforms into a stunning display of colour.
