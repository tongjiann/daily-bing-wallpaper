Once called Bear Lodge, the butte gained its current name during an 1875 expedition led by Colonel Richard Irving Dodge, possibly after an interpreter mistranslated a Native phrase as 'Bad God's Tower.' The missing apostrophe in its official title follows standard geographic naming conventions—hence, the signs read 'Devils Tower.' In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed it the nation's first national monument; a milestone whose anniversary falls today.","date":"Sep 24, 2025","bsTitle":"The lonely giant","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250924_BearLodge%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"543d315ebce4fd35f68974fa4ecdf015","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BearLodge_EN-US9061134971_tmb.jpg","title":"Devils Tower National Monument, Wyoming","desc":"Somewhere in the wide prairies of northeastern Wyoming stands Devils Tower, a stone formation that rises from the open plains.

A member of the Ramphastidae family, which includes toucan barbets, it is one of more than 40 toucan species. Found from southern Mexico to northern Colombia, it spends much of its day plucking fruit with a rainbow-colored bill about one-third of its total length. It also eats insects, eggs, and small reptiles when available. The bill not only helps it eat but also keeps the toucan cool by radiating excess heat—thanks to the blood vessels running through it. This social bird often moves in small groups, chattering and gliding between treetops. With each wing measuring 7–8 inches, the keel-billed toucan molts, or sheds its feathers, just once a year.","date":"Sep 23, 2025","bsTitle":"Beak-side story","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250923_ToucanForest%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b8af7ba71fadb07f7d0f2f6137a61d9b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ToucanForest_EN-US8319635845_tmb.jpg","title":"A keel-billed toucan in Costa Rica","desc":"Spot a flash of yellow on its chest and a bill that looks painted by an artist—that's the keel-billed toucan.
