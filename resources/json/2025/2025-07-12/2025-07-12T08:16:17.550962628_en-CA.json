Technically part of the superfamily Papilionoidea, they're often mistaken for moths thanks to their stout bodies and erratic flight patterns. But unlike moths, they're active by day, have clubbed antennae with a hook at the end and wings they usually hold at quirky angles. Their name? It comes from their quick, darting flight.","date":"Jul. 4, 2025","bsTitle":"A blur among the blooms","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250704_EchinaceaButterfly%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"76431ca52818b73a85896eb47c5f6995","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EchinaceaButterfly_EN-CA7402334180_tmb.jpg","title":"Skipper butterfly on an Echinacea flower","desc":"When it comes to fast flyers with a flair for flowers, the skipper butterfly makes quite the landing.
