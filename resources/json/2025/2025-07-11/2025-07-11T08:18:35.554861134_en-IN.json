The event was inspired by Five Billion Day in 1987, which marked the approximate date when the global population hit that milestone. As cities expand, green spaces shrink and agriculture competes for limited land and water resources. But there is a way forward—investing in education, improving access to healthcare and building smarter cities can balance growth with sustainability.","date":"Jul 11, 2025","bsTitle":"Counting us all in","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250710_TokyoSunrise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"704c45a9362a3b80ec770d478456e4ab","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TokyoSunrise_EN-IN0638589694_tmb.jpg","title":"World Population Day","desc":"We are living in a full house, and it is getting fuller.
