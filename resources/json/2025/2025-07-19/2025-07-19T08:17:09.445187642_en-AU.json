Eucalyptus is now one of the most planted species in the country, the basis for the production of paper, cellulose and charcoal. When well-managed, especially in already degraded areas, it can relieve pressure on native forests and favour soil recovery. However, in large areas, the continuous cultivation of eucalyptus can alter the local environment, affecting biodiversity and water dynamics.","date":"18 Jul 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250718_EucaliptoSC%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c18c61c6ae4782cf9d6174e5b5a08846","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EucaliptoSC_ROW7955901675_tmb.jpg","title":"Eucalyptus forest, Urubici, Santa Catarina, Brazil","desc":"Today's image takes us to Santa Catarina in Brazil.

These remarkable trees are the oldest non-clonal species on Earth. Shaped by relentless wind, snow and rain, they've endured for millennia—witnessing ice ages, volcanic eruptions and the rise and fall of civilisations. Their incredibly slow growth results in wood that's dense and highly resistant to insects, fungi, decay and erosion. Against all odds, the Great Basin bristlecones cling to life on barren limestone ridges, twisting into forms that appear almost sculpted by time. Their scattered presence across isolated mountain ranges may be due to wind dispersal, the help of birds like the Clark's nutcracker, or even now-extinct species that once carried their seeds across the highlands.","date":"15 Jul 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250715_PerseidsPine%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ed258d0ca989adba948950c4e7423f17","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PerseidsPine_ROW8981452096_tmb.jpg","title":"Great Basin National Park, Nevada, United States","desc":"Featured in today's image is Great Basin National Park in Nevada, United States, where ancient bristlecone pines stand beneath a sky ablaze…","hash":"SpMscPDRRT+phzuR8DnmGnkedU6DI3/zPS8OhyaJSCw="}},{"startdate":"20250714","fullstartdate":"202507140700","enddate":"20250715","url":"/th?id=OHR.YoungShark_ROW8712681767_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.YoungShark_ROW8712681767","copyright":"Young blue shark swimming off the coast of Galicia, Spain (© Damocean/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=blue+shark&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250714_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Young blue shark","copyrightonly":"© Damocean/Getty Images","desc":"The blue shark, featured here, is sleek, wide-ranging and undeniably captivating.

Here, evidence of volcanic activity is on full display in the form of rare hexagonal basalt columns. These sea cliffs are shaped into natural sculptures so symmetrical that they look almost man-made. These striking formations were created around 2 million years ago, when thick basalt lava cooled slowly, contracting and cracking into geometric shapes that formed near-perfect hexagons.
