This small, grey songbird, measuring about 15 centimetres in length, is a lively inhabitant of the eastern North America. Unlike other small songbirds, it has a tufted grey crest that crowns its head, giving it a distinctive and expressive look. Despite its small size, the tufted titmouse is surprisingly strong, able to crack open even large seeds with its beak—showcasing its skill and resourcefulness in the daily pursuit of food. It forages both in the trees and on the ground, searching for a varied diet of insects, nuts, seeds, berries and other invertebrates.","date":"14 Dec 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251214_TuftedTitmouse%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"585256f5e2c5bd1ca9618b0080db73ae","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TuftedTitmouse_ROW4045050908_tmb.jpg","title":"Tufted titmouse","desc":"Before you spot it, you'll likely hear it—a series of clear, whistling notes, often described as 'peter-peter-peter,' announcing the…","hash":"TxES4kL2N41L3b+uctaQVT0nfcYQiLQactZabknR/MY="}},{"startdate":"20251213","fullstartdate":"202512130800","enddate":"20251214","url":"/th?id=OHR.YosemiteWinter_ROW3941721184_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.YosemiteWinter_ROW3941721184","copyright":"Merced River, Yosemite National Park, California, United States (© Ron and Patty Thomas/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Merced+River&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251213_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Merced River, Yosemite National Park, California, United States","copyrightonly":"© Ron and Patty Thomas/Getty Images","desc":"Every masterpiece needs a brushstroke to tie it together.
