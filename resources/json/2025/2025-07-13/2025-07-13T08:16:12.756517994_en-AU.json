Named after the resilient mesquite trees that grow here, the dunes offer breathtaking views at sunrise and sunset, as well as exceptional stargazing opportunities.","date":"6 Jul 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250706_MesquiteFlats%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"78df9d091a61d072615aa0853698a719","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MesquiteFlats_ROW5187767291_tmb.jpg","title":"Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes in Death Valley National Park, United States","desc":"The Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, located near Stovepipe Wells Village in Death Valley National Park, are the most accessible and iconic dunes…","hash":"5289r+kZ0zzRgVXpX3fj+kZOX7OvxpUVTj63IBYsXJ4="}},{"startdate":"20250705","fullstartdate":"202507050700","enddate":"20250706","url":"/th?id=OHR.BolozonViaduct_ROW4997285549_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.BolozonViaduct_ROW4997285549","copyright":"Cize-Bolozon viaduct crossing the Ain gorge, France (© Leonid Andronov/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Cize+Bolozon+viaduct&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250705_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Cize-Bolozon viaduct, France","copyrightonly":"© Leonid Andronov/Getty Images","desc":"Imagine a bridge that connects more than just two sides of a river.
