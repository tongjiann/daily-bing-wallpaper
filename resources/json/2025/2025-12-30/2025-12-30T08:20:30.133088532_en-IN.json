Whooper swans have touched down. One loud whoop—and winter suddenly feels awake. These birds migrate from Siberia and the Russian Far East, choosing Japan as their seasonal home because its lakes offer what long-distance travellers crave: open water, steady food and a safe place to rest. One of their favourite destinations is Kotoku Pond in the Kantō region on Japan's largest island.","date":"Dec 30, 2025","bsTitle":"Whoop, there they fly","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251229_JapanSwans%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ae21e0997dd8cbdfb8a62f9a27ac9fe4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JapanSwans_EN-IN9853925542_tmb.jpg","title":"Whooper swans, Kotoku Pond, Japan","desc":"In Japan's colder months, there's a morning moment when stillness breaks—not with wind or footsteps, but with a bright, rolling call that…","hash":"Mlee72UzGX3T2lSw2LX5wTKd77UoT0gAgzpWzvtg3Q4="}},{"startdate":"20251228","fullstartdate":"202512281830","enddate":"20251229","url":"/th?id=OHR.AniTurkey_EN-IN9670620964_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.AniTurkey_EN-IN9670620964","copyright":"St. Gregory Church in Ani Ruins, Kars, Türkiye (© Kenan Talas/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Ani+Ruins&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251228_1830%22","title":"The church that outlived a city","caption":"St. Gregory Church in Ani Ruins, Kars, Türkiye","copyrightonly":"© Kenan Talas/Getty Images","desc":"On a windswept plateau in eastern Türkiye, along the border with Armenia, the ruins of the ancient city of Ani rise from the landscape with striking clarity.

Their hooves shrink in winter to expose a gripping rim, then expand in warmer months for better traction. Still not impressed? Consider this: reindeer don't have an internal clock.
