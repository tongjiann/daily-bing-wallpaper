These majestic giants roam freely across places like Amboseli National Park in Kenya, pictured here. What makes elephants so extraordinary isn't just their size; it's their minds. These animals have incredible memories. Matriarchs, the oldest females, can recall the locations of water sources from decades past, and they use that knowledge to lead their herds through tough times. Their social bonds run just as deep. Elephants live in close-knit families, mourn their dead and have even been observed comforting one another during hard times.","date":"12 Aug 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250812_KenyaElephants%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"50189321cf69b6b4b9e04169678d7ace","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KenyaElephants_ROW4632844635_tmb.jpg","title":"African elephants","desc":"Big ears, bigger hearts—elephants are more than just icons of the wild.

The reserve's rich ecosystem and seasonal wildebeest migration offer a front-row seat to the drama of lion life—from territorial battles to cooperative hunts. But Maasai Mara is more than a wildlife haven; it's a model for community-led conservation. Local Maasai communities work alongside conservationists to protect both lions and their ancestral lands, showing that coexistence is not only possible but powerful.","date":"10 Aug 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250810_LionessKenya%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b8b84d4ef4e20f59bf64b02eb45e498f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LionessKenya_ROW4235545619_tmb.jpg","title":"Lioness in Kenya","desc":"Featured in today's image are among the most iconic big cats in the animal kingdom—the lions—known for their powerful roar which can be…","hash":"q+68T11UEK3OCgleUNmwueQRN+TjdhP4AqxcmSeCgzc="}},{"startdate":"20250809","fullstartdate":"202508090700","enddate":"20250810","url":"/th?id=OHR.RotatoriaLetras_ROW3601160329_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.RotatoriaLetras_ROW3601160329","copyright":"Letters Square Roundabout, Manaus, Brazil (© Cristian Lourenço/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Letters+Roundabout+Manaus&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250809_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Letters Square Roundabout, Manaus, Brazil","copyrightonly":"© Cristian Lourenço/Getty Images","desc":"Amid the fast-paced traffic of Manaus, in Amazonas, Brazil, there's a point where meaning dissolves.

Made of stainless steel and about 4 metres tall, its original name, 'Diálogo,' never stuck. For residents, it was always 'Bola das Letras.' And so, it remained: a spontaneous nickname, a reference that slipped out of control and became part of the urban landscape.

As they grow, they separate from their mom and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well.
