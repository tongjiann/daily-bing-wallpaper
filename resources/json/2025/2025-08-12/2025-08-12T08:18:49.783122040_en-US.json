What makes elephants so extraordinary isn't just their size; it's their minds. These animals have incredible memories. Matriarchs, the oldest females, can recall the locations of water sources from decades past, and they use that knowledge to lead their herds through tough times. Their social bonds run just as deep. Elephants live in close-knit families, mourn their dead, and have even been observed comforting one another during hard times.","date":"Aug 12, 2025","bsTitle":"Wild, wise, and wonderful","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250812_KenyaElephants%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c52b98229b8989b42a44ebad55237809","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KenyaElephants_EN-US8723347309_tmb.jpg","title":"World Elephant Day","desc":"Big ears, bigger hearts—elephants are more than just icons of the wild.

In La Jolla, California, tide pools teach you about ocean life—right at your feet. Along the rocky shoreline of this San Diego coastal neighborhood, tide pools form during low tide as seawater gets trapped in natural depressions. These shallow pools form naturally along La Jolla's rocky shorelines, especially near Windansea Beach, Shell Beach, South Casa Beach, and Hospital Point. The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars. Over time, the tide pools are created through the process of erosion—waves hit the sandstone and limestone coastlines until they carve out pockets that hold water. Twice a day, as the tide moves in and out, these spaces flood and drain, challenging the survival skills of everything inside. Winter months, when tides are lowest during daylight hours, are ideal for observing them.","date":"Aug 5, 2025","bsTitle":"Tide and seek","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250805_CaliforniaTidepool%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a7938ee5e169e66be5f19a3c7b9246d4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CaliforniaTidepool_EN-US9089576317_tmb.jpg","title":"Tide pools in La Jolla, California","desc":"Not every science lesson requires a classroom.
