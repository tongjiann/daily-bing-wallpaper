The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars.","date":"Aug 5, 2025","bsTitle":"Tide and seek","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250804_CaliforniaTidepool%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"26ff45957b78d6481d0e1f36dd6b989d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CaliforniaTidepool_EN-IN9579127212_tmb.jpg","title":"Tide pools in La Jolla, California, United States","desc":"Not every science lesson requires a classroom.
