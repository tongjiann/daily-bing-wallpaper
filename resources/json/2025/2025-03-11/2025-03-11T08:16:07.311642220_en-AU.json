This medium-sized bird measures about 48 to 50 centimetres in length with a wingspan of 60 centimetres and weighs 150 to 200 grams. Recognisable by its bright yellow, curved bill, this bird is often seen hopping on the ground in search of food. Its diet includes insects, seeds, fruits, berries, nuts and small reptiles, making it a key player in the ecosystem as both a predator and seed disperser. Social creatures, these hornbills are usually found in pairs or small groups, often foraging together. They nest in natural tree cavities, with the female sealing herself inside using a mud wall, leaving only a small slit through which the male feeds her and the chicks. Their calls—whistling, grunting and cackling—echo across the savannah.","date":"3 Mar 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250303_HornbillPair%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"36f96b03b3eaedbd0bc2ee9fca30f5a5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HornbillPair_ROW3184273725_tmb.jpg","title":"Yellow-billed hornbills in Kruger National Park, South Africa","desc":"Today's image features the southern yellow-billed hornbill, a bird found throughout Southern Africa and commonly spotted in Kruger National…","hash":"f2SUyCpHsWLrQPzC7MQz678hg5JBPkuEKcXOJI0TVeg="}},{"startdate":"20250302","fullstartdate":"202503020800","enddate":"20250303","url":"/th?id=OHR.EucalyptusForest_ROW3147112022_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.EucalyptusForest_ROW3147112022","copyright":"Eucalyptus trees, Megalong Valley, Blue Mountains National Park, NSW, Australia (© Andrew Peacock/TANDEM Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Blue+Mountains+National+Park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250302_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Megalong Valley, Blue Mountains National Park, NSW, Australia","copyrightonly":"© Andrew Peacock/TANDEM Stills + Motion","desc":"Today, we are in New South Wales, Australia, amid the Blue Mountains National Park.

According to legend, an emperor's former wife, out of devotion, transformed into a tigress and carried Guru Padmasambhava from Tibet to Taktsang in Bhutan. There, he meditated in a cave and emerged in eight incarnations, which is why it is known as the 'Tiger's Nest.' Paro Taktsang is made up of four main temples, all connected by stairways cut into the cliff face, as well as a handful of rickety bridges. There are three main routes to reach the monastery, with the most popular path winding through a forest decorated with prayer flags. The hike is demanding but rewarding, providing breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.","date":"28 Feb 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250228_BhutanMonastery%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"928968ef0d335ba9e0ec8c2802a9af48","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BhutanMonastery_ROW3073381457_tmb.jpg","title":"Taktsang Palphug Monastery, Bhutan","desc":"Today's image takes us to Taktsang Palphug, also known as the Tiger's Nest, a Buddhist monastery and holy site perched 3,000 metres above…","hash":"a3UyB5hZJxsD1To3cuO2YZ8bB56+Xahgw055u9SImeA="}},{"startdate":"20250227","fullstartdate":"202502270800","enddate":"20250228","url":"/th?id=OHR.PolarCub_ROW4617288706_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.PolarCub_ROW4617288706","copyright":"Polar bear cub, Churchill, Manitoba, Canada (© Eric Baccega/NPL/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Manitoba&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250227_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Polar bear cub, Churchill, Manitoba, Canada","copyrightonly":"© Eric Baccega/NPL/Minden Pictures","desc":"Polar bears are native to the Arctic and can be found in Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Svalbard.

Polar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Their fur isn't truly white; it's translucent, reflecting visible light and allowing them to blend seamlessly into their snowy environment. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves. Protecting polar bears means protecting their home—let's work together to slow the effects of climate change and safeguard their future.","date":"27 Feb 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250227_PolarCub%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a1e34e8ff2fcb47bfa35754ac1547346","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PolarCub_ROW4617288706_tmb.jpg","title":"Polar bear cub, Churchill, Manitoba, Canada","desc":"Polar bears are native to the Arctic and can be found in Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Svalbard.

The first European Americans arrived in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and some eventually settled there in the 1850s. Bryce Canyon was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who had a homestead nearby. These days, the park is famous for its hoodoos.
