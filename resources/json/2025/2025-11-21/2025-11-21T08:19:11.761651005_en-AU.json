Adults can weigh almost 170 kilograms and reach lengths of up to 2 metres. They display a variety of colours, from white or silvery grey to black or dark brown, often marked with distinctive spots and V-shaped nasal openings.","date":"21 Nov 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251121_SealWaving%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"edc903424173817f7408753c8a04a0ae","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SealWaving_ROW8856649845_tmb.jpg","title":"Harbour seals","desc":"Today's image features harbour seals—also known as common seals—which are true pinnipeds distinguished by their lack of visible ear flaps…","hash":"OB2KT0BHz/xBj+TLUQiBcuKMCRYl7ZKfE9jjBctKcr8="}},{"startdate":"20251120","fullstartdate":"202511200800","enddate":"20251121","url":"/th?id=OHR.PondCave_ROW8757145455_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.PondCave_ROW8757145455","copyright":"Chapada Diamantina, Bahia, Brazil (© Marcio Dufranc/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Chapada+Diamantina&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251120_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Chapada Diamantina, Bahia, Brazil","copyrightonly":"© Marcio Dufranc/Getty Images","desc":"Chapada Diamantina is a natural beauty that seems to have emerged straight from a dream.
