The highlight is the massive Buddha in Cave 5, which is a jaw-dropping 17 metres tall. But don't stop there—each cave offers something unique. Some are like ancient storyboards, depicting tales from Buddhist scriptures, while others showcase detailed carvings of monks, deities, musician and even scenes of daily life under Wei rule.","date":"11 Feb 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250211_YungangGrottoes%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"565a7d3bf64daefe533baa04ea9f6f16","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YungangGrottoes_ROW4043208628_tmb.jpg","title":"Yungang Grottoes, Datong, China","desc":"What do 51,000 ancient statues have in common?

Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency.
