Legend has it that if he emerges from his burrow on February 2 and sees his own shadow, Canadians brace for an extended winter; no shadow means an early spring is on the way. Though it is celebrated mostly in Ontario, other places like Nova Scotia and Quebec also take part in the fun. The tradition has deep roots, first appearing in the early 1800s when European settlers brought similar customs to North America. Historically, Europeans celebrated today as the first day of spring, and Germans originally watched badgers and other small animals for signs of seasonal change important to farmers.","date":"Feb. 2, 2025","bsTitle":"Weather or not","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250202_AustriaMarmot%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d10076c488b0fc31f0f3bf8034ab9c76","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AustriaMarmot_EN-CA2613536224_tmb.jpg","title":"Groundhog Day","desc":"It's Groundhog Day… again.
