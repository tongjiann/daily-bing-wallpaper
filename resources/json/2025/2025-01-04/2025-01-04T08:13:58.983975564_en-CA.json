Found along the coastlines of over 140 countries, they nest in more than 80 countries year-round. They are rarely found in Canada because they prefer warmer, tropical and subtropical waters, which Canadian waters do not provide. Despite their size and strength, they face significant challenges, including hunting, boat collisions and entanglement in fishing nets. In the image, the turtle is gliding over staghorn coral, a threatened species of marine invertebrates. This coral can grow to around 2 metres and is crucial to marine ecosystems. Thanks to its rapid growth, it acts as a marine nursery for juvenile fish, as well as providing buffer zones against erosion and storms. Let's take a moment to appreciate the progress we've made in protecting our planet's most vulnerable species—and remember that the work is far from over.","date":"Dec. 28, 2024","bsTitle":"Shell-abrating a life","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241228_CoralTurtle%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ca835e71eed4cbedd156e8e0a3a9893c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CoralTurtle_EN-CA4867100726_tmb.jpg","title":"Green sea turtle","desc":"Today's image shows an endangered green sea turtle swimming in the waters off New Caledonia in the southwest Pacific Ocean.

The 2-kilometre lake, surrounded by the snow-dusted Julian Alps, was formed over 14,000 years ago through glacial and tectonic activity. The first signs of settlement on Bled Island date back to the New Stone Age (10,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE). Additionally, archaeologists uncovered an Early Medieval graveyard here from the 9th century CE. Today, it houses the Church of the Assumption—built in its current form near the end of the 17th century—where visitors ring the 'wishing bell' for good luck.","date":"Dec. 27, 2024","bsTitle":"Icy reflections and snow-dusted peaks","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241227_LakeBledSnow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3a14011a7ba993501a4aa731e1c4ea65","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LakeBledSnow_EN-CA4421792798_tmb.jpg","title":"Lake Bled, Slovenia","desc":"Lake Bled in Slovenia gets plenty of attention in summer, but winter?
