As a basic human right, literacy is a powerful tool that opens the door to greater freedoms and active global citizenship.

This year, the theme explores literacy in a digital age, where technology continues to reshape how people learn, communicate and participate in society. As a result, digital engagement has become both a challenge and an opportunity.","date":"Sep. 8, 2025","bsTitle":"Booked for the day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250908_OrchardLibrary%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"dcf9c17f8adf899c920b1bb125beb366","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OrchardLibrary_EN-CA5905828145_tmb.jpg","title":"International Literacy Day","desc":"Read it and believe it—literacy changes everything.

Don't be fooled by their shaggy coats and lumbering walk—these predators can weigh up to 410 kilograms and still run at 56 km/h.
