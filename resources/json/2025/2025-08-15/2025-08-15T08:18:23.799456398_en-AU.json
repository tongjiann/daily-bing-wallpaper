And like many lighthouses around the world, Florida's Gasparilla Island Lights still hold their ground. The Gasparilla Island Rear Range Light, seen in today's image, has had quite a journey. Originally assembled in Delaware, it found its forever home here in 1927 but was decommissioned by the Coast Guard in 2014. The lighthouse was restored to its former glory in 2017 and was switched on again in 2018. Today, it blinks white every six seconds. The lighthouse grounds and museum are open to visitors seasonally, offering insights into the area's shipping past.","date":"7 Aug 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250807_GasparillaLight%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fbbea2ad05f946317d969375bb340b96","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GasparillaLight_ROW6062509878_tmb.jpg","title":"Gasparilla Island Rear Range Light, Boca Grande, Florida, United States","desc":"Before GPS told ships where to go, lighthouses lit the way—each with its own flash pattern so sailors could figure out where they were, even…","hash":"Xj0FSwQpd2/5UYeA+qI2hChzXZSu19vlEGfrlCOCmtQ="}},{"startdate":"20250806","fullstartdate":"202508060700","enddate":"20250807","url":"/th?id=OHR.BabyLemur_ROW5956965002_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.BabyLemur_ROW5956965002","copyright":"Ring-tailed lemur infant playing with its own tail, Madagascar (© Andy Rouse/Nature Picture Library)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Ring+tailed+lemur&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250806_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Ring-tailed lemur","copyrightonly":"© Andy Rouse/Nature Picture Library","desc":"It looks like this small creature is playing a game, right?

The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama.","date":"6 Aug 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250806_BabyLemur%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ea0fe5cf28dde5fabf964176c9f38070","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BabyLemur_ROW5956965002_tmb.jpg","title":"Ring-tailed lemur","desc":"It looks like this small creature is playing a game, right?
