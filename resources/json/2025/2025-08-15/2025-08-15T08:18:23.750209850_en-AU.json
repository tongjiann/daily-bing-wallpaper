Gliding through the ocean with flapping fins and polka-dot flair, the spotted eagle ray refuses to blend in. It doesn't crawl along the seabed like its stingray cousins—it flies underwater. The species gets its name from—you guessed it—its protruding snout, which resembles an eagle's beak and its distinctive spotted back, which is unique to each individual, much like fingerprints. Their wing-like pectoral fins can span up to 3 metres. Near the base of the long tail are venomous spines, in case a predator gets too close. These rays aren't aggressive, but they're not defenceless either.","date":"15 Aug 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250815_SpottedEagleRay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6fde66f0d0396c13f2513c55509bd5f2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpottedEagleRay_ROW5085410852_tmb.jpg","title":"Spotted eagle rays","desc":"It's a bird, it's a plane, it's … a fish!

The Corona Arch Trail starts off easy but packs a punch of scenery: railroad tracks, slickrock scrambles and even a metal cable assist makes it more than just a walk in the desert. After 2.4 kilometres of walking, the payoff is big: a massive arch that's 43 metres wide and 32 metres high. It's so large that people once swung from it on ropes, until that was banned for safety reasons. Even without the adrenaline stunts, the hike offers beautiful views and unforgettable moments in the heart of Red Rock Country.","date":"13 Aug 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250813_CoronaArch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e415836891dc68b048df7e0d2c56bcc9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CoronaArch_ROW4754489590_tmb.jpg","title":"Corona Arch near Moab, Utah, United States","desc":"Just outside Arches National Park in Utah, United States, lies a natural wonder that rises like a colossal doorway against the sky, drawing…","hash":"fbL5tSDaVrQnb3acyxp1mJXe61BKiwvSTaky5SPXdpM="}},{"startdate":"20250812","fullstartdate":"202508120700","enddate":"20250813","url":"/th?id=OHR.KenyaElephants_ROW4632844635_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.KenyaElephants_ROW4632844635","copyright":"African elephant herd, Amboseli National Park, Kenya (© Chase Dekker/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=African+elephant&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250812_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"African elephants","copyrightonly":"© Chase Dekker/Minden Pictures","desc":"Big ears, bigger hearts—elephants are more than just icons of the wild.

The reserve's rich ecosystem and seasonal wildebeest migration offer a front-row seat to the drama of lion life—from territorial battles to cooperative hunts.

Made of stainless steel and about 4 metres tall, its original name, 'Diálogo,' never stuck. For residents, it was always 'Bola das Letras.'
