This vibrant city is one of the capitals and the most populous city in the Canary Islands, an archipelago belonging to Spain. Located on the northeastern coast of the island of Gran Canaria, Las Palmas is home to over 380,000 people and serves as a major port and commercial hub in the Atlantic. The city's distinctive palette of painted buildings—seen here from above—adds striking colour to neighbourhoods like Risco de San Juan, where homes are built into the hillsides. Founded in 1478, Las Palmas has a layered history shaped by Spanish colonisation, maritime trade and migration. Today, it is known for its subtropical desert climate—with average temperatures ranging from 15°C in winter to 27°C in summer—and for Las Canteras Beach, one of the best urban beaches in Europe.","date":"Jul 25, 2025","bsTitle":"Canvas of life","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250724_LasPalmas%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"bea0681aef2f16736bbb2ab593f1b0cd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LasPalmas_EN-IN7081028129_tmb.jpg","title":"Colourful houses of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain","desc":"If you're eager to explore faraway landscapes this summer, let us take you to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.

The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about two centimetres per year, revealing colourful bands of volcanic ash, silt and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels and sabre-toothed cats.","date":"Jul 22, 2025","bsTitle":"Epic sunsets and ancient secrets","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250721_BadlandsSunset%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d42f0753fa16e2f63a4398ce0b52d85e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BadlandsSunset_EN-IN8164722915_tmb.jpg","title":"Badlands National Park, South Dakota, United States","desc":"As the sun sets over Badlands National Park, the landscape transforms into a stunning display of colour.
