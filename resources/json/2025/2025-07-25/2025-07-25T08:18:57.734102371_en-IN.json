The shallow, white sandbanks reflect sunlight in a way that gives the ocean its signature electric-blue glow, pictured here.

From late June to mid-July, this high plateau transforms into a purple sea of lavender. Situated more than 500 metres above sea level and spanning approximately 800 square kilometres, it is one of the largest areas in France dedicated to lavender cultivation. Lavender has flourished in Provence for centuries. The ancient Romans brought the plant to southern France, using it for bathing, cooking and healing. Today, 1,700 growers tend to do more than 200 square kilometres of these shrubs. They cultivate both traditional lavender—for perfumes and skincare—and lavandin, the longer-stemmed cousin often found in household cleaning products and air fresheners. So don't just leave it to chance—plan ahead, follow the scent trail, and let your summer bloom with lavender memories.","date":"Jul 17, 2025","bsTitle":"Fragrant horizons","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250716_FranceLavender%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5b8191045eb094383bb6563e07fa72d9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FranceLavender_EN-IN6275328084_tmb.jpg","title":"Lavender fields in Plateau de Valensole, France","desc":"If you're looking for a scent-sational summer trip, follow your nose to the Plateau de Valensole in Provence, France.

Take the blue shark, featured here, for example—sleek, wide-ranging and undeniably captivating. It's the only living member of its genus, and it prefers the deep waters of temperate and tropical oceans.

If you're wondering where to see geology in action, Iceland is a great place to explore. Today's image takes us to Kálfshamarsvík—a secluded cove on the country's remote Skagi peninsula.
