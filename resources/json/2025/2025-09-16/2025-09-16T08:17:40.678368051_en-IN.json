While it prefers the shelter of forests, this agile creature easily adapts to gardens and parks. It builds its nest, called a drey, high in the fork of a tree using twigs to form a domed structure about 25 to 30 centimetres wide. The female featured here is gathering moss—one of several soft materials, along with bark, leaves and grass, that line the nest and turn it into a snug, well-insulated retreat. These rodents may also take over tree hollows or abandoned woodpecker holes when available.","date":"Sep 9, 2025","bsTitle":"Twig by twig, she prepares","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250908_SwissSquirrel%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"24e706d87c7b7467f3ce0d3ab28b028a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SwissSquirrel_EN-IN0066763187_tmb.jpg","title":"A female Eurasian red squirrel, Switzerland","desc":"Quick, clever and always on the move—meet the Eurasian red squirrel, a leafy treetop resident found across much of Europe and Asia.

As a basic human right, literacy is a powerful tool that opens the door to greater freedoms and active global citizenship.

Functional literacy means understanding the causes of deprivation and working to change them. It involves gaining skills to improve one's economic status and overall well-being. Recognising its far-reaching impact, International Literacy Day—observed each year on September 8 since 1967—serves as a reminder of how vital literacy is in building a better, more sustainable future for all. This year, the theme explores literacy in a digital age, where technology continues to reshape how people learn, communicate and participate in society.","date":"Sep 8, 2025","bsTitle":"Booked for the day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250907_OrchardLibrary%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"38d838095db2081cfe40eb87af9bb860","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OrchardLibrary_EN-IN9883780906_tmb.jpg","title":"International Literacy Day","desc":"Read it and believe it—literacy changes everything.
