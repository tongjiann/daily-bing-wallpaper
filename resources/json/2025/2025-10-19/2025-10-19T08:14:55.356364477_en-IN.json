Despite its name, this village isn't directly on the Saranac Lakes themselves but rather on Lake Flower, a wide section of the Saranac River. For centuries, the area—nicknamed 'The Capital of the Adirondacks'—was used by Indigenous peoples for hunting and travel. By the late 19th century, it gained fame as a health retreat, where Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau pioneered fresh-air treatment for tuberculosis. The cure cottages from that era still stand today.","date":"Oct 12, 2025","bsTitle":"Falling for Saranac","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251011_SaranacLake%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c3ab69ee89448fa94b2ec3ca09651fc5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SaranacLake_EN-IN0774753637_tmb.jpg","title":"Village of Saranac Lake, New York, United States","desc":"Some places are just stops on the map, but Saranac Lake in Adirondack Mountains, in New York, United States, is a destination that keeps…","hash":"C9AH9MH4sj97ICCvI7aXfPv3yls9E2LiAdBE4uggp8s="}},{"startdate":"20251010","fullstartdate":"202510101830","enddate":"20251011","url":"/th?id=OHR.WoodDuckHen_EN-IN0584855660_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.WoodDuckHen_EN-IN0584855660","copyright":"Wood duck hen, United States (© ps50ace/iStock/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=World+Migratory+Bird+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251010_1830%22","title":"Nest stop: Mexico!","caption":"World Migratory Bird Day","copyrightonly":"© ps50ace/iStock/Getty Images","desc":"Birds don't bother with passports, visas or luggage—they simply spread their wings and fly.

Their golden glow depends on many factors—tree health, local weather shifts, soil moisture and where they grow in terms of altitude and latitude.
