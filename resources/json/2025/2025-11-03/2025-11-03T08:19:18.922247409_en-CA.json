During Diwali, families clean and decorate their homes, exchange sweets and gather for prayers, creating an atmosphere of joy. Central to the celebration are diyas, small oil lamps whose glowing flames symbolise light overcoming darkness and the promise of new beginnings. One of the most remarkable places to see the lights of the season is Harmandir Sahib, also known as the Golden Temple, in Amritsar, India. This gurdwara, a sacred site in Sikhism, welcomes people of all faiths.

Their deliberate movements conserve energy, avoid predators and even allow algae to grow on their fur, creating green camouflage among the canopy.
