Alberobello's trulli aren't hidden one-offs. Entire districts—like Rione Monti and Aia Piccola—are packed with these quirky structures.

Their incredibly slow growth results in wood that's dense and highly resistant to insects, fungi, decay and erosion. Against all odds, the Great Basin bristlecones cling to life on barren limestone ridges, twisting into forms that appear almost sculpted by time. Their scattered presence across isolated mountain ranges may be due to wind dispersal, the help of birds like the Clark's nutcracker, or even now-extinct species that once carried their seeds across the highlands.","date":"Sep 1, 2025","bsTitle":"Timeless glow","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250831_PerseidsPine%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c420713b95d8399db305373ba96082e1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PerseidsPine_EN-IN9650707879_tmb.jpg","title":"Great Basin National Park, Nevada, United States","desc":"Featured in today's image is Great Basin National Park in Nevada, United States, where ancient bristlecone pines stand beneath a sky ablaze…","hash":"SpMscPDRRT+phzuR8DnmGnkedU6DI3/zPS8OhyaJSCw="}},{"startdate":"20250830","fullstartdate":"202508301830","enddate":"20250831","url":"/th?id=OHR.ScottsBluff_EN-IN3788273216_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ScottsBluff_EN-IN3788273216","copyright":"Scotts Bluff National Monument in Gering, Nebraska, United States (© Hawk Buckman/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Scotts+Bluff+National+Monument&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250830_1830%22","title":"Painted clouds, still cliffs","caption":"Scotts Bluff National Monument, Nebraska, United States","copyrightonly":"© Hawk Buckman/Getty Images","desc":"Long before GPS, natural landmarks like Scotts Bluff in Nebraska, United States, rose high above the prairie, signalling to travellers that they were on the right path heading west.
