Grand processions at Chaitya Bhoomi in Mumbai and Deeksha Bhoomi in Nagpur draw large crowds, while tributes and cultural events take place nationwide. National leaders honour Ambedkar at the Parliament. Beyond India, the celebration resonates globally, especially among Dalits, Adivasis, labourers, women and those inspired by his Buddhist ideals.","date":"Apr 14, 2025","bsTitle":"Tribute to an iconic leader","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250413_AmbedkarMemorialIN%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8f94a5326df8a2bc57b4818990ae23b9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AmbedkarMemorialIN_EN-IN5190883644_tmb.jpg","title":"Ambedkar Jayanti","desc":"Ambedkar Jayanti is a reminder of the life and legacy of Dr. B.R.

Thailand's Songkran festival is a unique mix of spiritual traditions and all-out water fights. Held from April 13 to 15 this year, the holiday is deeply rooted in Buddhist customs and focuses on cleansing and starting afresh. During this time, people visit temples, offer food to monks and pour scented water over Buddha statues and elders' hands as a sign of respect. Those seeking a calmer way to celebrate might consider visiting Wat Tang Sai Temple in Ban Krut, seen in today's image. Perched on Thong Chai Mountain, this temple complex is home to an over 10-metre-tall Buddha statue and Thai-style pagodas. Built in 1996 to honour King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) on his 50th year of reign (1946–2016), it remains an important spiritual site. With stunning coastline views, Wat Tang Sai offers a peaceful setting to meditate and feel the vibrations of Buddhist chants.","date":"Apr 13, 2025","bsTitle":"Let's celebrate Songkran!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250412_ThailandPagodas%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"83964a9ebec103e3ee5bed0a4de71ea8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ThailandPagodas_EN-IN4796043507_tmb.jpg","title":"Songkran—Thai New Year","desc":"New Year celebrations don't always come with fireworks—sometimes, they come with buckets and a nationwide water splash fest!
