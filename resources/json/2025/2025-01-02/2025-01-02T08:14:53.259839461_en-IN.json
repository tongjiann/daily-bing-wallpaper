In the past, it was customary for the wealthy to give boxes filled with gifts to their servants on the day after Christmas. The tradition evolved into a day for charitable giving to the less fortunate. Today, while the spirit of giving remains, it has transformed into a holiday enjoying bustling sales and a lineup of soccer matches. However, December 26th in India is marked by a more somber remembrance—the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, which is why the disaster is often referred to as the 'Boxing Day Tsunami.'","date":"Dec 26, 2024","bsTitle":"The holidays continue","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241225_MouseholeXmas%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f3b0ac10f73951b211030652c2407c80","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MouseholeXmas_EN-IN6968521248_tmb.jpg","title":"Boxing Day","desc":"As the last notes of Christmas carols linger in the air, Boxing Day arrives.

Christmas Day is a holiday packed with joy, warmth and cherished traditions. For many, it's a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ, bringing family and friends together to exchange gifts, share meals and enjoy festive décor. Beyond its spiritual roots, Christmas also lights up the season with beloved customs—decorating trees, carolling and eagerly awaiting Santa's arrival. Recognised as a state holiday in India, Christmas is celebrated as a secular occasion. For Christians, particularly Catholics, attending Midnight Mass is a key tradition. Many Christian households adorn their homes with cribs, trees and brightly lit stars symbolising the Bethlehem star. They also share sweets and cakes with neighbours. In northern and north-western regions, it's known as Bada Din (Big Day), and some communities mark the occasion by planting trees.","date":"Dec 25, 2024","bsTitle":"Merry Christmas!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241224_ReindeerTrio%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"69c2a3e5d63af15ad1f03181a851d522","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ReindeerTrio_EN-IN0167081195_tmb.jpg","title":"Merry Christmas!","desc":"Deck the halls, it's Christmas time!

The lower stonework boasts delicate floral carvings from the Gupta era, while its walls feature finely detailed depictions of humans, birds and inscriptions in the ancient Brahmi script.
