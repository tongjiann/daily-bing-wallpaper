The featured image shows the Golden Temple in Amritsar, where festivities unfold with splendour. As dawn settles over the marble walkways, pilgrims gather in reverent silence, their hymns rising through the cool November air. The temple's reflection shimmers across the 'sarovar,' the sacred pool that surrounds it; by night it glows against the dark sky as celebrations reach their peak. Rooted in 15th-century Punjab, this festival embodies Guru Nanak's enduring message of unity and compassion. Observed on Kartik Purnima, the full moon day of Kartik in the Nanakshahi calendar, the date shifts each year in the Gregorian calendar, usually falling in November.","date":"Nov 5, 2025","bsTitle":"Celebrating Guru Nanak Gurpurab","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251104_GurpurabAmritsar%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"64853e55079d36977347b4586f5c673d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GurpurabAmritsar_EN-IN2812865988_tmb.jpg","title":"Guru Nanak Gurpurab","desc":"Glowing lamps, devotional music and shared meals—today we celebrate Guru Nanak Gurpurab, which marks the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak…","hash":"PdyMjKAFuiR81NFwqUlMpE7PB/XnVL06bzlc/zq8Br0="}},{"startdate":"20251103","fullstartdate":"202511031830","enddate":"20251104","url":"/th?id=OHR.TowerBridgeUK_EN-IN1788130859_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.TowerBridgeUK_EN-IN1788130859","copyright":"Tower Bridge, London, England (© Nick Brundle Photography/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Tower+Bridge+London&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251103_1830%22","title":"Mind the gap—this one opens","caption":"Tower Bridge, London, England","copyrightonly":"© Nick Brundle Photography/Getty Images","desc":"Some bridges connect two sides.
