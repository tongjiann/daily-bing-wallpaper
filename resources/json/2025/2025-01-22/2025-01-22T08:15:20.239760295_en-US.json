For the first time, a national museum flung its doors wide open, offering free access to knowledge and culture for all. The story begins with Sir Hans Sloane, an Anglo-Irish physician and avid collector. His collection of more than 71,000 items, ranging from books and manuscripts to botanical samples and antiquities, formed the museum's foundation. Fast-forward 266 years, and the museum now houses more than 8 million objects, the largest collection of artifacts in the world, although only about 1% of the collection is currently on display. Its treasures span continents and millennia, from the Rosetta Stone—key to deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs—to the Parthenon Sculptures, the Benin Bronzes, and samurai armor.","date":"Jan 15, 2025","bsTitle":"Where the past is always present","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250115_MuseumCourt%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"00baa961738492b4f5bdf5555c58aba4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MuseumCourt_EN-US0003531841_tmb.jpg","title":"Anniversary of the British Museum","desc":"January 15, 1759, marked the opening of a place that would become the pride of London, a hub of global history, and a keeper of countless…","hash":"rR7pEg+qSVeOlwIcCOWjin1xoLkLmqlc8LbIb8KWW08="}},{"startdate":"20250114","fullstartdate":"202501140800","enddate":"20250115","url":"/th?id=OHR.CadizSpain_EN-US9699586606_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.CadizSpain_EN-US9699586606","copyright":"Village of Zahara de la Sierra overlooking Zahara-El Gastor Reservoir, Cádiz province, Spain (© SEN LI/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Andalusia&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250114_0800%22","title":"Calmness overload","caption":"Village of Zahara de la Sierra, Cadiz, Spain","copyrightonly":"© SEN LI/Getty Images","desc":"Zahara de la Sierra, a stunning whitewashed village in the hills of Cádiz province in Spain, offers a blend of history and nature in the south of the Iberian Peninsula.

Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs, and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food, or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples.
