This centuries-old Lanna tradition celebrates the 12th lunar month with glowing paper lanterns—khom loi—that are released to honor the Buddha. Each lantern is believed to carry away misfortune and light the way toward a brighter future. Children steady the lantern frames, elders whisper blessings, and the crowd pauses as hundreds of lights drift higher than the trees. Farther south, the same full moon watches over Loy Krathong, a sister festival, where candlelit rafts glide across the water.","date":"Nov 6, 2025","bsTitle":"Sky full of wishes","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251106_LanternsThailand%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5f3f50287a0e5197d8d246d30d713134","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LanternsThailand_EN-US6955074347_tmb.jpg","title":"Celebrating Yi Peng","desc":"What would you wish for if a single lantern could carry your heart's desire skyward?
