Shaped by relentless wind, snow and rain, they've endured for millennia—witnessing ice ages, volcanic eruptions and the rise and fall of civilisations. Their incredibly slow growth results in wood that's dense and highly resistant to insects, fungi, decay and erosion. Against all odds, the Great Basin bristlecones cling to life on barren limestone ridges, twisting into forms that appear almost sculpted by time. Their scattered presence across isolated mountain ranges may be due to wind dispersal, the help of birds like the Clark's nutcracker, or even now-extinct species that once carried their seeds across the highlands.","date":"Sep 1, 2025","bsTitle":"Timeless glow","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250831_PerseidsPine%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c420713b95d8399db305373ba96082e1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PerseidsPine_EN-IN9650707879_tmb.jpg","title":"Great Basin National Park, Nevada, United States","desc":"Featured in today's image is Great Basin National Park in Nevada, United States, where ancient bristlecone pines stand beneath a sky ablaze…","hash":"SpMscPDRRT+phzuR8DnmGnkedU6DI3/zPS8OhyaJSCw="}},{"startdate":"20250830","fullstartdate":"202508301830","enddate":"20250831","url":"/th?id=OHR.ScottsBluff_EN-IN3788273216_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ScottsBluff_EN-IN3788273216","copyright":"Scotts Bluff National Monument in Gering, Nebraska, United States (© Hawk Buckman/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Scotts+Bluff+National+Monument&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250830_1830%22","title":"Painted clouds, still cliffs","caption":"Scotts Bluff National Monument, Nebraska, United States","copyrightonly":"© Hawk Buckman/Getty Images","desc":"Long before GPS, natural landmarks like Scotts Bluff in Nebraska, United States, rose high above the prairie, signalling to travellers that they were on the right path heading west.

Whale sharks are the biggest fish in the sea, but don't let the word 'shark' fool you. They're plankton-eating giants with no interest in humans. Found in warm waters from the Maldives and Mozambique to Mexico's Yucatán coast, they often show up in food-rich, calm waters.

Fish are their main prey, but they also eat frogs, reptiles and even small mammals. In the late 1800s, the great egret's beautiful plumes became a must-have in women's fashion across North America, driving their population down by an estimated 95%. The killing might have continued if not for two Boston socialites, Harriet Hemenway and Minna Hall, who led a boycott of the feather trade.
