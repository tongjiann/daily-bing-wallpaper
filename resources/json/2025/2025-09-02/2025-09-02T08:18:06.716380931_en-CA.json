But instead of magic wands, it was limestone, mortar-free masonry and—according to some theories—a bit of tax evasion that built this town's signature homes: the trulli. These are whitewashed stone houses topped with dry-stacked limestone roofs shaped like upside-down ice cream cones. It's an ancient building technique, and in this case, a clever one. Back in the 14th century, locals were reportedly trying to avoid property taxes by constructing homes that could be quickly dismantled when the king's tax collector came around.","date":"Aug. 26, 2025","bsTitle":"A 'trulli' remarkable town","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250826_TrulliHouses%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"bb8fef0e44ac007e94996a698cedcb0f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TrulliHouses_EN-CA2142617397_tmb.jpg","title":"Trullo buildings in Alberobello, Apulia, Italy","desc":"If fairy tales had architects, they might've come up with something like Alberobello in Italy.

Bonifacio is divided into two sections, with the 'vieille ville' (old town)—also known as 'la Haute Ville' (the Upper City)—standing on a high cliff within the original citadel walls.
