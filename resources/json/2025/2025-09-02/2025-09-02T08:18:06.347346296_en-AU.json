Thanks to the fertile soils and mild climate, grape varieties such as Pinot Gris and Pinot Noir thrive here. The volcanic past has left behind mineral-rich soil that gives the region's wines their unique character.

Their breeding patterns remain largely a mystery, but they are ovoviviparous, meaning pups hatch inside the mother before being born alive.
