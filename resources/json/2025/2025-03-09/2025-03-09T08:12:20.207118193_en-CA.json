Daylight saving time (DST) starts today at 2 AM, reminding us that time, quite literally, waits for no one. The idea is simple: maximising daylight and reducing energy consumption by syncing our activities with the natural light cycle. This concept was popularised by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century, though his suggestion to 'save candles' was more satirical than a serious proposal. Fast forward to the early 20th century, and many countries adopted DST to conserve fuel during wartime. Today, DST runs from March to November in around 70 countries, giving us eight months of extended evening light.","date":"Mar. 9, 2025","bsTitle":"The March of time","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250309_ItalyClock%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"30c63914485213311611ca58674582a7","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ItalyClock_EN-CA0044429164_tmb.jpg","title":"Daylight saving time begins","desc":"It's that time of year again—when clocks spring forward, stealing an hour of sleep but giving us longer evenings to enjoy.

Today, it's marked by events, protests and campaigns addressing issues like gender pay gaps, domestic violence and access to education.

If you've been to Edmonton, you've probably seen the Walterdale Bridge–that sleek, steel arch that stands tall over the river. Opened in 2017, this bridge replaced an ageing structure—named after John Walter, a Canadian business entrepreneur and an early settler in Fort Edmonton—that was constructed in 1913 by the Dominion Bridge Company. The new design features an impressive, curved arch, making it one of Edmonton's most modern and striking bridges. More than just a way to cross the river, it connects key parts of the city, making travel between the capital's downtown and Southside easier and faster.","date":"Mar. 6, 2025","bsTitle":"Bridging the gap","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250306_WalterdaleBridge%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d9d9f25135f77c7870c81ac0cea96a82","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WalterdaleBridge_EN-CA9868203704_tmb.jpg","title":"Walterdale Bridge in Edmonton, Alberta","desc":"Edmonton is always evolving.
