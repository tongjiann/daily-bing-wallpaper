The change usually begins in September and early October, with higher slopes turning first, followed by the lower valleys. Among the stars of this display are the aspens, whose leaves shimmer like gold coins in the sunlight. The magic of aspen colours, however, isn't guaranteed year after year. Their golden glow depends on many factors—tree health, local weather shifts, soil moisture and where they grow in terms of altitude and latitude. Healthy aspens are the true stars of the season: strong, thriving groves burst with brighter colours and hold onto their leaves longer, while stressed or weakened trees often fade quickly, offering only a glimpse of their usual brilliance. A spot that dazzled one fall might look muted the next.","date":"Oct 7, 2025","bsTitle":"Golden fall glow","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251006_RidgwayAspens%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"479ff38ccfc095e8a04975557b7d398c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RidgwayAspens_EN-IN9829823825_tmb.jpg","title":"Fall colours below Mount Sneffels near Ridgway, Colorado, United States","desc":"It's that time of year in the United States when the hills shed their summer greens, unveiling a blaze of colours that lights up the season…","hash":"HI8Hah4aCi28vq6u3oke8cAdy8/X03F9LXueM7bkrYU="}},{"startdate":"20251005","fullstartdate":"202510051830","enddate":"20251006","url":"/th?id=OHR.AnshunBridge_EN-IN9593478408_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.AnshunBridge_EN-IN9593478408","copyright":"Anshun Bridge illuminated for the Mid-Autumn Festival, Chengdu, China (© Philippe LEJEANVRE/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=mid+autumn+festival&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251005_1830%22","title":"To the moon and back","caption":"Anshun Bridge, Chengdu, China","copyrightonly":"© Philippe LEJEANVRE/Getty Images","desc":"The shiver felt under a full autumn moon, when the air hints at winter's arrival, has a way of lingering in memory.
