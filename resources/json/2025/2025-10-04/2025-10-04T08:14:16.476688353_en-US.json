It was born from the launch of Sputnik 1 by the USSR in 1957 and the signing of the Outer Space Treaty in 1967, a pioneering international commitment to peaceful cosmic exploration. During this week, classrooms buzz with experiments, planetariums echo with wonder, and telescopes bridge the gap to distant galaxies. Together, these moments weave a universal story of science, discovery, and humanity's relentless drive to push boundaries. The week's mission is clear: to ignite the next generation of explorers, engineers, and dreamers ready to rewrite the cosmos.","date":"Oct 4, 2025","bsTitle":"Mission: Possible","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251004_DragonEndeavour%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a7511aad9c5210cec968309e5d72e740","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DragonEndeavour_EN-US9321246369_tmb.jpg","title":"World Space Week","desc":"From October 4 to 10, World Space Week invites us to transcend our earthly bounds and chase the stars.
