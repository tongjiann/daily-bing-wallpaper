Meet the red maple, pictured here. This tree isn't just a pretty face—its sap is a key ingredient in Canada's famous maple syrup. Most syrup, however, comes from sugar maples, though black maples and red maples also contribute. Curious how? In spring, taps collect sap when nights are still freezing and days begin to warm. Boil it down, and what's left is the sweet syrup you drizzle on pancakes. Canada produces more than 70% of global maple syrup, with Quebec leading production.","date":"Sep. 27, 2025","bsTitle":"Nature's red couture","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250927_RedMapleleaf%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7fb53b26cc89f2259097486f925eb990","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RedMapleleaf_EN-CA8222399050_tmb.jpg","title":"Red maple","desc":"Ever wondered what gives those fiery red leaves their vibrant colour each fall?

A member of the Ramphastidae family, which includes toucan barbets, it is one of more than 40 toucan species. Found from southern Mexico to northern Colombia, it spends much of its day plucking fruit with a rainbow-coloured bill about one-third of its total length. It also eats insects, eggs and small reptiles when available. The bill not only helps it eat but also keeps the toucan cool by radiating excess heat—thanks to the blood vessels running through it. This social bird often moves in small groups, chattering and gliding between treetops. With each wing measuring around 17-20 centimetres, the keel-billed toucan moults, or sheds its feathers, just once a year.","date":"Sep. 23, 2025","bsTitle":"Beak-side story","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250923_ToucanForest%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3379a2d56ac6bb662eefbd797fbbae0c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ToucanForest_EN-CA5712281059_tmb.jpg","title":"Keel-billed toucan, Costa Rica","desc":"Spot a flash of yellow on its chest and a bill that looks painted by an artist—that's the keel-billed toucan.
