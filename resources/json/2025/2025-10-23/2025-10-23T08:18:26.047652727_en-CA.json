It commemorates Prince Rama's victorious return to the kingdom of Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana. The festival also honours the goddess Lakshmi, who is believed to bring wealth and well-being into homes, while some communities worship the goddess Kali. During Diwali, families clean and decorate their homes, exchange sweets and gather for prayers, creating an atmosphere of joy. Central to the celebration are diyas, small oil lamps whose glowing flames symbolise light overcoming darkness and the promise of new beginnings. One of the most remarkable places to see the lights of the season is Harmandir Sahib, also known as the Golden Temple, in Amritsar, India. This gurdwara, a sacred site in Sikhism, welcomes people of all faiths. Around the time of Diwali, Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas, marking the release of the sixth Sikh Guru, Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji, from imprisonment.","date":"Oct. 21, 2025","bsTitle":"Glowing traditions","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251021_DiyaDiwali%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"90479b5c49d6ac4ea4662b107b482281","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DiyaDiwali_EN-CA6346650196_tmb.jpg","title":"Diwali and Bandi Chhor Divas","desc":"Diwali is a vibrant Hindu festival celebrating hope, prosperity and the triumph of good over evil.

Sloths are tree-dwelling mammals native to Central and South America. Their deliberate movements conserve energy, avoid predators and even allow algae to grow on their fur, creating green camouflage among the canopy. Hoffmann's two-toed sloth, pictured here, is a prime example of the slow-paced lifestyle typical of all sloths. It spends most of its time in the trees, occasionally descending to the ground to move to a new one.","date":"Oct. 20, 2025","bsTitle":"Life in the slow lane","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251020_HoffmansSloth%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1295f20a1cac50dc54685ef641866dd9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HoffmansSloth_EN-CA8355906230_tmb.jpg","title":"International Sloth Day","desc":"How good would it feel if you could just hang out and do absolutely nothing all day?
