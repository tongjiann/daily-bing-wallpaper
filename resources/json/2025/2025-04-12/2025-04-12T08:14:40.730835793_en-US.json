San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, which dates back to the 10th century, has been rebuilt several times due to damage from battles and fire. Today's building is perched atop the islet and is accessible by a narrow path that includes 241 steps. It's a popular pilgrimage site, and visitors often ring the church bell three times and make a wish. According to legend, John the Baptist himself set foot on the islet. The views from the top offer panoramic vistas of the rugged coastline and the Cantabrian Sea. Gaztelugatxe gained international fame as a filming location for the TV series 'Game of Thrones,' where it served as Dragonstone, the ancestral seat of House Targaryen.","date":"Apr 5, 2025","bsTitle":"Pilgrimage to San Juan de Gaztelugatxe","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250405_GaztelugatxeSunset%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6e5018fbaf941fd4a8a630cef71fdf10","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GaztelugatxeSunset_EN-US9011894832_tmb.jpg","title":"Gaztelugatxe at sunset, Basque Country, Spain","desc":"Gaztelugatxe is a stunning islet located on the coast of Biscay in the Basque Country, Spain.

Nature's color wheel has long been linked to myths and legends, from Norse gods to the Irish leprechaun's pot of gold. But beyond folklore, the science behind rainbows is just as compelling. The first real explanation came from Theodoric of Freiberg, a German physicist, in 1304. He discovered that rainbows form when sunlight enters a raindrop, bends, reflects inside, and then bends again as it exits. This process splits light into its colors, creating the spectrum we see. The classic 'ROYGBIV' (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) doesn't tell the whole story—rainbows contain millions of colors blended together.","date":"Apr 3, 2025","bsTitle":"The sky is the limit","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250403_SaguaroRainbow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"48a6a269b460e9b9c14890977d40d8c4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SaguaroRainbow_EN-US0296037572_tmb.jpg","title":"National Find a Rainbow Day","desc":"Have you ever spotted a rainbow and felt a little lucky?
