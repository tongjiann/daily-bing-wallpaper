It's famous for its dramatic scenery and the small hermitage, San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, dedicated to John the Baptist at its peak. The hermitage, which dates back to the 10th century, has been rebuilt several times due to damage from battles and fire. Today's building is perched atop the islet and is accessible by a narrow path that includes 241 steps. It's a popular pilgrimage site and visitors often ring the church bell three times and make a wish. According to legend, John the Baptist himself set foot on the islet. The views from the top offer panoramic vistas of the rugged coastline and the Cantabrian Sea. Gaztelugatxe gained international fame as a filming location for the TV series 'Game of Thrones', where it served as Dragonstone, the ancestral seat of House Targaryen.","date":"5 Apr 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250405_GaztelugatxeSunset%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a41c830a00c6d1d285ef6f4eb9c5883a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GaztelugatxeSunset_ROW7944319082_tmb.jpg","title":"Gaztelugatxe islet at sunset, Basque Country, Spain","desc":"Gaztelugatxe is a stunning islet located on the coast of Biscay in the Basque Country, Spain.
