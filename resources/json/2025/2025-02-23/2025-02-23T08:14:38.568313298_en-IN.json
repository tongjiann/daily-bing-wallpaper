The country's tallest mountain rises more than 3,500 metres above the surrounding landscape, with its near-symmetrical cone covered in snow for nearly five months each year. For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshiped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami, and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain. February 23 is celebrated as Mount Fuji Day (富士山の日) because the word 'Fujisan' can be interpreted as '2, 2, 3.' Although it's not a national holiday, people often take the opportunity to learn more about this majestic peak. It's also a day to reflect on the future of the mountain, and how it can be preserved for future generations. Every year, more than 300,000 people climb Mount Fuji, and overtourism has become a real concern.","date":"Feb 23, 2025","bsTitle":"Wind of Fuji, my souvenir from Edo","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250222_MtFujiSunrise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c27aba5c9f07084cefdcdc2518e672ab","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MtFujiSunrise_EN-IN8980088662_tmb.jpg","title":"Mount Fuji Day","desc":"Over 90 kilometres southwest of Tokyo stands one of Japan's cultural icons: Mount Fuji.

At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking structure more than 190 metres tall that has become the ultimate symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape and the promise of a technologically advanced future.","date":"Feb 22, 2025","bsTitle":"Bending towards brilliance","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250221_StLouisArch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c3f2e763c1234e357eaf785a8202fd99","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.StLouisArch_EN-IN8948563304_tmb.jpg","title":"Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, United States","desc":"Today we are at the Gateway National Park, which was established on February 22, 2018, in St. Louis, Missouri, United States.

In Canada, these animals are primarily found in Alberta, with the prairies and parklands around the city of Red Deer offering an ideal habitat for them. The stags have antlers that grow larger each year until maturity and are usually over 70 centimetres long, weighing around 1 kilogram. These antlers have long been a symbol of power and are the only mammal organ capable of complete regeneration. Females, or hinds, are slightly smaller and antler-free, as seen in today's image. Breeding season, known as the rut, is a time of dramatic display as males compete fiercely for mates through roaring and antler clashes. The cultural significance of red deer represents the natural cycle of life. Artistic depictions, from medieval manuscripts to modern sculptures, frequently highlight their grace and strength.","date":"Feb 20, 2025","bsTitle":"A regal duo","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250219_CanadaDeer%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6553f63bec1791df9c7c53028d7b9a90","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CanadaDeer_EN-IN1563872531_tmb.jpg","title":"Red deer, Canada","desc":"Throughout history, red deer have captured humanity's awe and respect.
