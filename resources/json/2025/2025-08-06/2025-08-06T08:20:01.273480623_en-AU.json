These compact birds are easily recognised by their short, curved bills, square tails and long wings. They are usually seen in small groups, huddled closely together on bare branches, power lines or pylons, occasionally preening one another. Agile in flight, they make aerial sallies to catch insects mid-air—sometimes holding the prey in their feet, tearing it apart with their beaks. While they typically feed on the wing, they may also return to a perch—or even land on the ground—to consume their catch or visit birdbaths.","date":"24 Jul 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250724_AshyWoodswallow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9fac238459803ef19680145afcf945fd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AshyWoodswallow_ROW0000420936_tmb.jpg","title":"Family of ashy woodswallows","desc":"The ashy woodswallow, also known as the ashy swallow-shrike, is a sociable bird found across South and Southeast Asia, including India…","hash":"/Af3Pj3LUyVH4CVJBMq11gJAR6QuBrc/skbVT1EzBWo="}},{"startdate":"20250723","fullstartdate":"202507230700","enddate":"20250724","url":"/th?id=OHR.VaticanCity_ROW9915711454_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.VaticanCity_ROW9915711454","copyright":"Vatican City with Saint Peter's Basilica, Rome, Italy (© RudyBalasko/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Vatican+City&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250723_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Vatican City, Rome, Italy","copyrightonly":"© RudyBalasko/Getty Images","desc":"In the middle of Rome, Italy, lies an entire country of its own: Vatican City.
