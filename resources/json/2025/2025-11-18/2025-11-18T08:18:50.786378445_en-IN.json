These sandstone pillars, formed around 70 million years ago, are among Germany's most significant natural and cultural landmarks. They captivate visitors with their unique shapes and rich historical significance, attracting thousands each year. The rocks reach heights of up to 35 metres. As early as the Middle Ages, the site was used as a place of worship, as evidenced by a remarkable 12th-century relief carved into the stone depicting the Descent from the Cross. It is the oldest of its kind north of the Alps.","date":"Nov 11, 2025","bsTitle":"Where legends rise","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251110_ExternsteineSunset%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"07f5830f3b0235d4e300b1a2cb8de764","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ExternsteineSunset_EN-IN3574516917_tmb.jpg","title":"Externsteine in the Teutoburg Forest, Germany","desc":"Nestled in the heart of Germany's Teutoburg Forest, near the town of Horn-Bad Meinberg in North Rhine-Westphalia, the dramatic rock…","hash":"t8rLhWcmTRmxDPltzqYQthpKyi8UMtIEh+hCj87p1Do="}},{"startdate":"20251109","fullstartdate":"202511091830","enddate":"20251110","url":"/th?id=OHR.PrairieDogTown_EN-IN3372426738_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.PrairieDogTown_EN-IN3372426738","copyright":"Black-tailed prairie dogs at Roberts Prairie Dog Town, Badlands National Park, South Dakota, United States (© Greg Vaughn/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Black-tailed+prairie+dogs&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251109_1830%22","title":"Life hidden beneath the prairie","caption":"Black-tailed prairie dogs in Badlands National Park, United States","copyrightonly":"© Greg Vaughn/Getty Images","desc":"Across the stark stretches of South Dakota prairie, Badlands National Park is a landscape shaped by wind, water and time.
