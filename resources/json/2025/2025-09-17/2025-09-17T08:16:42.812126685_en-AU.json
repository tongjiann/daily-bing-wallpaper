Hay baling plays a crucial role in agriculture worldwide. It involves cutting, drying and packaging grasses to feed livestock during the colder months. The process depends heavily on the weather: the grass must be dry before it's baled, or it risks moulding. Farmers must act quickly once a dry spell arrives, making it a seasonal race.","date":"10 Sep 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250910_YorkshireHay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f22c9139f57e78834da0abed1c8ce9b1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YorkshireHay_ROW7331770812_tmb.jpg","title":"Hay bales in North Yorkshire, England","desc":"'Make hay while the sun shines' may sound like an old proverb, but in farming it's a practical truth.

It builds its nest, called a drey, high in the fork of a tree using twigs to form a domed structure about 25 to 30 centimetres wide. The female featured here is gathering moss—one of several soft materials, along with bark, leaves and grass, that line the nest and turn it into a snug, well-insulated retreat.
