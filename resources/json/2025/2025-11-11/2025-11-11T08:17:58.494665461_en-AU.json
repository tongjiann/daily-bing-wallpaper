These sandstone pillars, formed around 70 million years ago, are among Germany's most significant natural and cultural landmarks. They captivate visitors with their unique shapes and rich historical significance, attracting thousands each year. The rocks reach heights of up to 35 metres. As early as the Middle Ages, the site was used as a place of worship, as evidenced by a remarkable 12th-century relief carved into the stone depicting the Descent from the Cross. It is the oldest of its kind north of the Alps.","date":"11 Nov 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251111_ExternsteineSunset%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e5dc48657864cdd49ff9e9160c4be125","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ExternsteineSunset_ROW3073183805_tmb.jpg","title":"Externsteine, Teutoburg Forest, Germany","desc":"Nestled in the heart of Germany's Teutoburg Forest, near the town of Horn-Bad Meinberg in North Rhine-Westphalia, the dramatic rock…","hash":"Q9rtpEXRiJjI7f7KfV4QT0hV3xEdlIrzZlVUyMlPQ1Y="}},{"startdate":"20251110","fullstartdate":"202511100800","enddate":"20251111","url":"/th?id=OHR.PrairieDogTown_ROW3043607482_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.PrairieDogTown_ROW3043607482","copyright":"Black-tailed prairie dogs at Roberts Prairie Dog Town, Badlands National Park, South Dakota, United States (© Greg Vaughn/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Black-tailed+prairie+dog&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251110_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Black-tailed prairie dogs","copyrightonly":"© Greg Vaughn/Getty Images","desc":"In 1978, a stark stretch of South Dakota prairie gained recognition as one of America's natural treasures.

Despite its immense distance, it glimmers faintly in the night sky, one of only two star-forming nebulae visible to the naked eye from mid-northern latitudes, alongside the famous Orion Nebula. First recorded by Giovanni Hodierna in 1654, it is located in the constellation Sagittarius. In long-exposure photographs, the Lagoon Nebula may appear pink, but when viewed through a telescope it looks grey, as the human eye struggles to detect colour in low-light conditions.
