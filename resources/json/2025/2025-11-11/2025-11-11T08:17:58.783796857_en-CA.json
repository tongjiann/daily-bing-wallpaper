Their thick trunks store water, while their branches reflect heat, helping them endure harsh conditions. Reaching up to 7 metres in height, with some living for more than 100 years, quiver trees are also vital to their ecosystem. They offer rare perches and nesting sites for birds in landscapes where few other trees exist.","date":"Nov. 11, 2025","bsTitle":"Quivering under starlight","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251111_AloeDichotoma%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5d55e7a97f46cd9ba27e7d381ee9ba4d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AloeDichotoma_EN-CA9316195338_tmb.jpg","title":"Quiver trees, Keetmanshoop, Namibia","desc":"Of all the plants on Earth, the quiver tree looks the most like a vision from the future.
