On the right, we see a bird's-eye view of the Sydney Opera House, an architectural icon with sail-like shells that shine bright under the Australian sun. Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, this UNESCO World Heritage Site took 14 years to complete and hosts over 1,500 performances annually. Just across the harbour, to the left of the image, the Sydney Harbour Bridge—affectionately called 'the Coathanger' for its arching steel frame—connects the city's northern and southern shores. When it opened in 1932, it was the world's widest long-span bridge. Adventurous visitors can climb its more than 134-metre summit for breathtaking panoramic views.","date":"Mar 30, 2025","bsTitle":"Harbouring nice views","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250329_SydneyHarbour%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2181fb5efe531da6ca3ffc2b46b40d38","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SydneyHarbour_EN-IN0606023668_tmb.jpg","title":"Sydney Harbour, New South Wales, Australia","desc":"Today's image features a spot in Sydney, Australia, where shimmery waters meet famous landmarks: Port Jackson, more commonly known as Sydney…","hash":"E+9XES3Q4qJLm68r+f7VBlUFevKzj+MCx2q+wxLgXxw="}},{"startdate":"20250328","fullstartdate":"202503281830","enddate":"20250329","url":"/th?id=OHR.CarrizoBloom_EN-IN0314971879_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.CarrizoBloom_EN-IN0314971879","copyright":"Superbloom in Carrizo Plain National Monument, California, United States (© Robb Hirsch/TANDEM Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=superbloom+flowers+california&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250328_1830%22","title":"Burst of blooms","caption":"Superbloom in Carrizo Plain National Monument, California, United States","copyrightonly":"© Robb Hirsch/TANDEM Stills + Motion","desc":"It's not every day you see a desert burst into colours, but during a superbloom, the arid land is covered with endless stretches of flowers.

These gentle giants of the sea have been gliding through warm waters for millions of years, minding their own business and munching on seagrass. But despite their laid-back nature, they face serious threats. There are three species of manatees: the West Indian, the Amazonian and the African manatee. The West Indian manatee, which includes the Florida manatee, can grow up to 4 metres long and weigh over 450 kilograms. These peaceful creatures spend most of their time grazing and napping. They have no natural predators, but human activity poses a major risk. Boat strikes are a leading cause of injury and death, as these marine mammals are too slow to dodge speeding vessels. Habitat loss and pollution also threaten their survival. Conservation efforts, including speed limits in manatee zones and habitat protection, have helped, but these sea cows still need all the support they can get.","date":"Mar 26, 2025","bsTitle":"Life below the surface","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250325_CrystalManatee%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"32eeb5e734d02cf9601ebf4b17ea6ee1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CrystalManatee_EN-IN9367417729_tmb.jpg","title":"Manatee in Crystal River, Florida, United States","desc":"Manatees don't rush through life—they float.

These resilient, herbivorous creatures migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful.
