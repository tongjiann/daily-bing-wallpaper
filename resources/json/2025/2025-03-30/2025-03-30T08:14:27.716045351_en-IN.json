They play a crucial role in their bamboo forest ecosystem by dispersing seeds and fostering new vegetation growth, which benefits countless plants and animals. Once classified as 'endangered,' their conservation status was upgraded to 'vulnerable' in 2016, thanks to dedicated efforts such as breeding programmes, reforestation initiatives and habitat preservation. Despite this progress, fewer than 2,000 pandas remain in the wild, primarily due to habitat loss caused by deforestation and farming. Efforts to protect bamboo forests and improve breeding programmes are vital to their survival. While pandas may be cute and cuddly, they're also environmental heroes.
