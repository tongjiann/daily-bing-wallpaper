This architectural gem, built in the 16th century by the first Marquis of Zenete, combines military strength with the elegance of Italian palaces and is one of the earliest examples of the Renaissance in Spain. Perched at an altitude of 1,250 metres, the castle dominates the landscape of the Marquisate of Zenete and has been the scene of key historical events, from the Christian conquest to the Alpujarras Rebellion. Recently, it gained prominence after being chosen as the location for the series 'House of the Dragon,' created by Ryan Condal and George R.R. Martin.","date":"15 Apr 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250415_CerezoEnFlor%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"99c112688b3d931726a9b25f452e4209","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CerezoEnFlor_ROW0960888815_tmb.jpg","title":"Castillo de La Calahorra, Granada, Spain","desc":"In the region of Guadix, between mountains and valleys, stands La Calahorra, a small town with a monumental treasure, its imposing…","hash":"RoTjEucbk7+SJLzGuE+hJzdbuOeRK58f2C5v5dt9DEM="}},{"startdate":"20250414","fullstartdate":"202504140700","enddate":"20250415","url":"/th?id=OHR.SpottedDolphins_ROW9067273233_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.SpottedDolphins_ROW9067273233","copyright":"Atlantic spotted dolphins near Santa Maria Island, Azores, Portugal (© Jordi Chias/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Atlantic+spotted+dolphin&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250414_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Atlantic spotted dolphins near Santa Maria Island, Azores, Portugal","copyrightonly":"© Jordi Chias/Minden Pictures","desc":"Atlantic spotted dolphins—the stars of today's image—are known for the spots on their body, which multiply and become denser with age. When younger, they lack spots, often resembling slender bottlenose dolphins. You'll find them in the warm temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic, hunting fish in coordinated groups. They're fast swimmers, known for their playful bow-riding and acrobatic, shallow leaps. These dolphins are amazing team players when it comes to hunting, as they often hunt in groups, working together to surround their prey, which includes small fish, benthic invertebrates and even squid. Interestingly, they prefer to hunt at night, making the most of the cover of darkness to catch their prey. Their speed and agility make them efficient hunters—and a thrill to watch.","date":"14 Apr 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250414_SpottedDolphins%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"de9daa7fa80a35564346824b8615dfaf","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpottedDolphins_ROW9067273233_tmb.jpg","title":"Atlantic spotted dolphins near Santa Maria Island, Azores, Portugal","desc":"Atlantic spotted dolphins—the stars of today's image—are known for the spots on their body, which multiply and become denser with age.
