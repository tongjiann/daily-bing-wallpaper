The black-winged stilt, with its long, slender red legs, moves with quiet elegance through the shallows. Their presence sometimes evokes a quiet intimacy—two birds drifting close, their movements mirroring one another in a delicate choreography, as if sharing a secret only the wetlands can hear. They hunt with quiet precision, gently picking insects, larvae and tiny crustaceans from the water's surface. Each movement reveals a subtle mastery of their environment, shaped by patience and instinct.","date":"15 Sep 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250915_Echasse%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"36b7d832ef33c8b6533fa6cff9e3cb76","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Echasse_ROW7944797323_tmb.jpg","title":"Black-winged stilts, France","desc":"Across the shimmering lagoons of Africa, the winding deltas of Asia and the salt marshes of southern Europe, a graceful figure emerges…","hash":"7e7apCnkXoyhrIavoFKzS/CSBr/53ZfSyUSdp4ihHG4="}},{"startdate":"20250914","fullstartdate":"202509140700","enddate":"20250915","url":"/th?id=OHR.HohWaterfall_ROW7820858130_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.HohWaterfall_ROW7820858130","copyright":"A waterfall in Olympic National Park, Washington, United States (© Chris Moore/TANDEM Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Olympic+National+Park+Washington&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250914_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Olympic National Park, Washington, United States","copyrightonly":"© Chris Moore/TANDEM Stills + Motion","desc":"Olympic National Park covers a rare mix of terrain—and that's part of its unique appeal.

Farmers must act quickly once a dry spell arrives, making it a seasonal race.","date":"10 Sep 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250910_YorkshireHay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f22c9139f57e78834da0abed1c8ce9b1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YorkshireHay_ROW7331770812_tmb.jpg","title":"Hay bales in North Yorkshire, England","desc":"'Make hay while the sun shines' may sound like an old proverb, but in farming it's a practical truth.
