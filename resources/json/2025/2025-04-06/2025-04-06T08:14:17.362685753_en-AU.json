On the right, we see a bird's-eye view of the Sydney Opera House, an architectural icon with sail-like shells that shine bright under the Australian sun. Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, this UNESCO World Heritage Site took 14 years to complete and hosts over 1,500 performances annually. Just across the harbour, to the left of the image, the Sydney Harbour Bridge—affectionately called 'the Coathanger' for its arching steel frame—connects the city's northern and southern shores. When it opened in 1932, it was the world's widest long-span bridge. Adventurous visitors can climb its 134 metres summit for breathtaking panoramic views.","date":"30 Mar 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250330_SydneyHarbour%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"607845f3e33a732097713ed84966f3a8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SydneyHarbour_ROW8845962045_tmb.jpg","title":"Sydney Harbour, New South Wales, Australia","desc":"Today's image features a spot in Sydney, Australia, where shimmery waters meet famous landmarks: Port Jackson, more commonly known as Sydney…","hash":"E+9XES3Q4qJLm68r+f7VBlUFevKzj+MCx2q+wxLgXxw="}},{"startdate":"20250329","fullstartdate":"202503290700","enddate":"20250330","url":"/th?id=OHR.CarrizoBloom_ROW8748742226_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.CarrizoBloom_ROW8748742226","copyright":"Superbloom in Carrizo Plain National Monument, California, United States (© Robb Hirsch/TANDEM Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=superbloom+flowers+california&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250329_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Superbloom in Carrizo Plain National Monument, California, United States","copyrightonly":"© Robb Hirsch/TANDEM Stills + Motion","desc":"It's not every day you see a desert burst into colours, but during a superbloom, the arid land is covered with endless stretches of flowers.

These resilient, herbivorous creatures migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes almost 70 kilometres in a single night, to find their favourite myrrh bushes.","date":"24 Mar 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250324_ElephantGrass%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5eeabb2d1b1d8ee6e5e008a2a9822628","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ElephantGrass_ROW7641940719_tmb.jpg","title":"African elephants in Namibia","desc":"Desert elephants, found in Namibia and Mali, are African bush elephants that have adapted to the harsh conditions of the Namib and Sahara…","hash":"vHmxrv1OrciqV2JoUmFBTX3R72kDr9nPjeOsr/4RBDg="}},{"startdate":"20250323","fullstartdate":"202503230700","enddate":"20250324","url":"/th?id=OHR.NebraskaStorm_ROW7518048455_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.NebraskaStorm_ROW7518048455","copyright":"Lightning and storm clouds at sunset near Bowman, Nebraska, United States (© john finney photography/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Nebraska&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250323_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Lightning and storm clouds at sunset near Bowman, Nebraska, United States","copyrightonly":"© john finney photography/Getty Images","desc":"Pictured here is the awe-inspiring anvil crawler lightning in Nebraska, United States—a state renowned for its tornadoes and thunderstorms, typically during spring and summer.
