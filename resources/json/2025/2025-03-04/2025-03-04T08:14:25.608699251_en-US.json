At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking 630-foot-tall structure that has become the ultimate symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape, and the promise of a technologically advanced future.","date":"Feb 22, 2025","bsTitle":"Bending towards brilliance","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250222_StLouisArch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"23a2ef2bc2bc1c1c096ab427c358be64","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.StLouisArch_EN-US1920417205_tmb.jpg","title":"Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri","desc":"Today we are celebrating the anniversary of Gateway National Park, which was established on February 22, 2018, in St. Louis, Missouri.
