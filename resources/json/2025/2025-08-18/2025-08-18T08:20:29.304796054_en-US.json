In La Jolla, California, tide pools teach you about ocean life—right at your feet. Along the rocky shoreline of this San Diego coastal neighborhood, tide pools form during low tide as seawater gets trapped in natural depressions. These shallow pools form naturally along La Jolla's rocky shorelines, especially near Windansea Beach, Shell Beach, South Casa Beach, and Hospital Point. The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars. Over time, the tide pools are created through the process of erosion—waves hit the sandstone and limestone coastlines until they carve out pockets that hold water. Twice a day, as the tide moves in and out, these spaces flood and drain, challenging the survival skills of everything inside. Winter months, when tides are lowest during daylight hours, are ideal for observing them.","date":"Aug 5, 2025","bsTitle":"Tide and seek","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250805_CaliforniaTidepool%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a7938ee5e169e66be5f19a3c7b9246d4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CaliforniaTidepool_EN-US9089576317_tmb.jpg","title":"Tide pools in La Jolla, California","desc":"Not every science lesson requires a classroom.
