Santa Maddalena is small, quiet and deeply rooted in local Ladin and Tyrolean traditions. Wooden chalets dot the green hills, and cows graze in meadows that seem painted into place. Although it feels remote, the village is a gateway to some of the Dolomites' best hiking, including trails through Puez-Odle Nature Park.","date":"Aug 11, 2025","bsTitle":"Postcard from the peaks","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250810_SantaMaddalena%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"27546a2b2e48eb2d136fcb118a85ece9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SantaMaddalena_EN-IN3855112074_tmb.jpg","title":"Village of Santa Maddalena, Dolomites, Italy","desc":"Tucked into the northern Italian Alps, the village of Santa Maddalena is a postcard-perfect hamlet in South Tyrol's valley of Val di Funes…","hash":"HYWyv1T5fOplSzsEG8EYG3+Obh4uxeWEE7vJyE48PeY="}},{"startdate":"20250809","fullstartdate":"202508091830","enddate":"20250810","url":"/th?id=OHR.LionessKenya_EN-IN3681659136_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.LionessKenya_EN-IN3681659136","copyright":"Lioness in Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya (© Tandem Stock/Adobe Stock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=World+Lion+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250809_1830%22","title":"Roar for a cause","caption":"World Lion Day","copyrightonly":"© Tandem Stock/Adobe Stock","desc":"With a roar that echoes across the plains, lions have long captured the human imagination.

As they grow, they separate from their mom and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama.
