That's the spine-cheeked anemonefish, or the maroon clownfish, and it is not just a cute creature. Native to the Indo-Pacific, from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef, this species lives on the edges of coral reefs. This fish is easily distinguished by the spine extending from each cheek—hence the name. Groups of spine-cheeked anemonefish form around a single dominant female, and if she disappears, the top male steps up—literally changing sex to take her place. It thrives in warm, shallow waters and sticks close to its chosen sea anemone. The closest marine companion of a spine-cheeked anemonefish is the bubble-tip anemone, as seen in the image. These anemones don't all look alike—their appearances often vary with age, depth and whether they host anemonefish. This species offers the perfect mix of cover and protection.","date":"Jul 2, 2025","bsTitle":"In the bubble-tip zone","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250701_MaroonClownfish%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1d383f58e8e86c72673217a6b23258a3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MaroonClownfish_EN-IN6113544568_tmb.jpg","title":"Spine-cheeked anemonefish","desc":"That bright fish hiding in the anemone?

Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, the uprising challenged not only police brutality but society's silence. Stonewall wasn't the beginning of queer existence, but it was the moment people said 'no more' loud enough to be heard worldwide. Today, Stonewall stands as a symbol of resilience.

This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, its oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights. Breeding season gets creative. Females lay their eggs on leaves overhanging small pools or puddles. Once the eggs hatch, the tadpoles drop into the water below—no parental supervision required.","date":"Jun 27, 2025","bsTitle":"A splendid life","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250626_SplendidFrog%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"eaebc9ba8641c90fab12c6bed38fcc85","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SplendidFrog_EN-IN1765447694_tmb.jpg","title":"Splendid leaf frog","desc":"Don't let the name fool you—this frog isn't just leafing around.
