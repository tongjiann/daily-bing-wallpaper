The festival is deeply rooted in the ideals of the hippie movement, the 1960s counterculture and the free festival spirit that sparked its early days. From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael's Church Tower. The Tor is steeped in myth and legend, from ties to King Arthur's Avalon to ancient spiritual lore.","date":"Jun 25, 2025","bsTitle":"Tor and tunes: Glastonbury begins","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250624_GlastonburyScenic%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"788699b60b6c81f8e654a9740ea05654","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GlastonburyScenic_EN-IN0972355097_tmb.jpg","title":"Glastonbury Festival begins","desc":"As the sun rises over the hills in Somerset, the Glastonbury Festival comes alive, transforming a quiet part of South West England into one…","hash":"3P1uOgggoJLamcgslpm7z02l809VTE+jtwA25dz8NLg="}},{"startdate":"20250623","fullstartdate":"202506231830","enddate":"20250624","url":"/th?id=OHR.DelicateArch_EN-IN0498341649_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.DelicateArch_EN-IN0498341649","copyright":"Delicate Arch, Arches National Park, Utah, United States (© mmac72/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Delicate+Arch+Arches+National+Park+Utah&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250623_1830%22","title":"Nature took its time","caption":"Delicate Arch, Arches National Park, Utah, United States","copyrightonly":"© mmac72/Getty Images","desc":"This place wasn't built overnight—nature took its time to craft this masterpiece.
