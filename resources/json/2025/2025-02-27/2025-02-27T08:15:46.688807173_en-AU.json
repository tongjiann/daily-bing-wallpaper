These creatures can be found across Europe, Asia, parts of North Africa and a few other regions. The stags have antlers that grow larger each year until maturity and are usually over 70 centimetres long, weighing around 1 kilogram. These antlers have long been a symbol of power and are the only mammal organ capable of complete regeneration. Females, or hinds, are slightly smaller and antler-free, as seen in today's image. Breeding season, known as the rut, is a time of dramatic display as males compete fiercely for mates through roaring and antler clashes. The cultural significance of red deer represents the natural cycle of life. Artistic depictions, from medieval manuscripts to modern sculptures, frequently highlight their grace and strength.","date":"20 Feb 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250220_CanadaDeer%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5a7a8b66c848594a7f72144863b90161","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CanadaDeer_ROW4993266615_tmb.jpg","title":"Red deer, Canada","desc":"Throughout history, red deer have captured humanity's awe and respect.

A single square centimetre of their fur can hold more than 70,000 hairs, making it one of nature's most effective insulators. River otters were once endangered due to pollution and habitat loss.

These penguins, found in coastal Patagonia, are known for their distinctive black and white bands and their loud, braying calls. They also mate with the same partner every year. They dig burrows near the coast to lay their eggs and raise their chicks. The male returns to burrows he used the year before and waits for his partner, who can recognise him by his voice alone. Their diet mainly consists of small fish, squid and krill. They can dive up to 50 metres depth to forage for food. In winter, they migrate north to warmer waters, sometimes reaching as far as southern Brazil. These penguins are highly social and often seen in large colonies, where they communicate with each other through their distinctive calls.
