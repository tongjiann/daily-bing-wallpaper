Despite its name, this village isn't directly on the Saranac Lakes themselves but rather on Lake Flower, a wide section of the Saranac River. For centuries, the area—nicknamed 'The Capital of the Adirondacks'—was used by Indigenous peoples for hunting and travel. By the late 19th century, it gained fame as a health retreat, where Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau pioneered fresh-air treatment for tuberculosis. The cure cottages from that era still stand today.","date":"12 Oct 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251012_SaranacLake%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e46c95841369ca03f198e724dc36d071","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SaranacLake_ROW9913011112_tmb.jpg","title":"Saranac Lake, New York","desc":"Some places are just stops on the map, but Saranac Lake in the Adirondack Mountains in New York, United States, is a destination that keeps…","hash":"R9D8NK5PUItB1m1aY8n/XQZ+1bu3NGFfpXWPqL9yk/o="}},{"startdate":"20251011","fullstartdate":"202510110700","enddate":"20251012","url":"/th?id=OHR.WoodDuckHen_ROW9793950559_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.WoodDuckHen_ROW9793950559","copyright":"Wood duck hen, United States (© ps50ace/iStock/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Wood+duck+hen&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251011_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Wood duck hen","copyrightonly":"© ps50ace/iStock/Getty Images","desc":"The wood duck, pictured here, is one of the most colourful waterfowl in North America.

The reefs act as a natural fortress, protecting the island from storms while sheltering countless species of fish. They are a fitting metaphor: strong, diverse and deeply connected to the well-being of the nation. Beyond its waters, Monuriki is also home to the endangered Fiji crested iguana, one of the few places where this rare reptile can still be found.

Found across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, from Hawaii in the United States to Africa's eastern coast, this reef-dweller is a true shapeshifter. Unlike most of its kin, it hunts in broad daylight, instantly shifting its colour, pattern and even skin texture to blend into its surroundings. At times, it even performs a clever 'passing clouds' act, casting a false shadow to trick crabs into moving at just the wrong moment. And once the trap is sprung, the hunter wastes no time. A skilled predator, this octopus prowls the reef for fish, crabs, prawns and molluscs. Smaller catches are devoured on the spot, while larger prey is dragged back to its den.","date":"8 Oct 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251008_OctopusCyanea%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fcc67823efdfc3402f7118e88fdb342b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OctopusCyanea_ROW4586818693_tmb.jpg","title":"Octopus cyanea","desc":"Meet the master of disguise—the day octopus (Octopus cyanea).

The original bridge was built in 1746 but suffered repeated damage from floods over the centuries. The current structure, completed in 2003, preserves the architectural style of the Ming and Qing dynasties and spans 81 metres in length and 6 metres in width. The bridge features handrails with traditional floral carvings, water-beast statues on the piers and memorial archways on each side, reflecting classic Chinese architecture.
