The name 'Trevi' comes from Tre Vie—'three roads'—signifying the junction where it stands. Designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and finished by Giuseppe Pannini, this 86-foot marvel is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous in the world. Its sculptures show Oceanus, the god of the sea, surrounded by Tritons and horses.","date":"Nov 25, 2025","bsTitle":"Love, luck, and loose change","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251125_TreviFountain%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"117d085e7f949a5ea15732b4508396f0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TreviFountain_EN-US6800145474_tmb.jpg","title":"Trevi Fountain, Rome, Italy","desc":"Ever heard coins clinking louder than applause?

He was so devoted that when funding ran out, he reportedly gouged out his own eyes to prove his sincerity. Construction took roughly 90 years and was completed long after Hai Tong's death. At 233 feet tall, it is the largest stone Buddha in the world. Its shoulders stretch about 92 feet wide, its ears measure nearly 23 feet long, and each foot extends over 28 feet.
