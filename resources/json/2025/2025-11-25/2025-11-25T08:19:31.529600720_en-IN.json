Males, known as drakes, stand out with their fan-shaped white crests, dark heads and chestnut-brown sides, while females, called hens, are brownish grey with smaller crests. Oregon's lakes and wetlands provide sheltered feeding grounds as these birds migrate or winter across the continent.","date":"Nov 18, 2025","bsTitle":"Autumn's feathered headliner","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251117_AutumnMerganser%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6bc01c56622e854190139998b1af26c3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AutumnMerganser_EN-IN3826172336_tmb.jpg","title":"Male hooded merganser, Oregon, United States","desc":"Each autumn, the quiet waterways of Oregon, United States, become seasonal waypoints for hooded mergansers—small diving ducks native to…","hash":"clBPM+dvn715ccRBG+ViSx0mk9iAhBEfL6FxIb9e9Jg="}},{"startdate":"20251116","fullstartdate":"202511161830","enddate":"20251117","url":"/th?id=OHR.ShenandoahTrail_EN-IN3789880572_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ShenandoahTrail_EN-IN3789880572","copyright":"Autumn colours in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, United States (© Michael Ver Sprill/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Shenandoah+National+Park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251116_1830%22","title":"The trails' call","caption":"Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, United States","copyrightonly":"© Michael Ver Sprill/Getty Images","desc":"Today's image features Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, United States.
