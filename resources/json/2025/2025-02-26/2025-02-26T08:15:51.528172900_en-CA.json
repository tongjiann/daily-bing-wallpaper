Despite falling into disrepair by the 19th century, it was lovingly restored in the mid-20th century and is still privately owned today.

For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshipped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami, and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain. February 23 is celebrated as Mount Fuji Day (富士山の日) because the word 'Fujisan' can be interpreted as '2, 2, 3.' Although it's not a national holiday, people often take the opportunity to learn more about this majestic peak. It's also a day to reflect on the future of the mountain, and how it can be preserved for future generations. Every year, more than 300,000 people climb Mount Fuji, and over-tourism has become a real concern.","date":"Feb. 23, 2025","bsTitle":"Wind of Fuji, my souvenir from Edo","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250223_MtFujiSunrise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a96085d9e44980bdf1bdebb17e0ceb31","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MtFujiSunrise_EN-CA7120845966_tmb.jpg","title":"Mount Fuji Day","desc":"Around 100 kilometres southwest of Tokyo stands one of Japan's cultural icons: Mount Fuji.

At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking 192-metre-tall structure that has become the ultimate symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape and the promise of a technologically advanced future.","date":"Feb. 22, 2025","bsTitle":"Bending towards brilliance","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250222_StLouisArch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"51ca2702c91d989cfa3185b85a0a8de5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.StLouisArch_EN-CA6246210465_tmb.jpg","title":"Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, United States","desc":"Today we are at the Gateway National Park, which was established on February 22, 2018, in St. Louis, Missouri, United States.
