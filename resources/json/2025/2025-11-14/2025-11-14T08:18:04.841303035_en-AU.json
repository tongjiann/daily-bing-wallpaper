Perched between the regions of Transylvania—renowned for its chilling tales—and Wallachia, once ruled by Vlad III Dracula, the castle evokes a haunting legacy. Vlad's ruthless reputation inspired Bram Stoker's 1897 novel 'Dracula.' Though the story is not set at Bran Castle, its looming form and persistent rumours of Vlad's presence blur fact and legend, forever linking it to one of humanity's most enduring tales.","date":"31 Oct 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251031_BranCastle%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e2054a5d8b878c5c4bdd65b44610c107","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BranCastle_ROW9947564327_tmb.jpg","title":"Bran Castle in Bran, Brașov, Romania","desc":"Featured in today's image is Bran Castle, one of Romania's most iconic landmarks, where centuries of history blend seamlessly with myth and…","hash":"e3mizuwEetfJTke6hqIeQIid3bRUg41H7o/HQ20US1k="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
