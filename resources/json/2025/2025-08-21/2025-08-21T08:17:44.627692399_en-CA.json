Welcome to Corona Arch, seen in today's image, a towering Navajo sandstone formation that offers big adventure without the big crowds. The Corona Arch Trail starts off easy but packs a punch of scenery: railroad tracks, slickrock scrambles and even a metal cable assist make it more than just a walk in the desert. After a 2.4-kilometre walk, the payoff is big: a massive arch that's 43 metres wide and 32 metres high. It's so large that people once swung from it on ropes, until that was banned for safety reasons.","date":"Aug. 13, 2025","bsTitle":"Earth's open secret","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250813_CoronaArch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d997b3c901917f19bc756bdde3abc9b6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CoronaArch_EN-CA7314989674_tmb.jpg","title":"Corona Arch near Moab, Utah, United States","desc":"Just outside Arches National Park in Utah, United States, lies a natural wonder that rises like a colossal doorway against the sky, drawing…","hash":"fbL5tSDaVrQnb3acyxp1mJXe61BKiwvSTaky5SPXdpM="}},{"startdate":"20250812","fullstartdate":"202508120400","enddate":"20250813","url":"/th?id=OHR.KenyaElephants_EN-CA6960133643_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.KenyaElephants_EN-CA6960133643","copyright":"African elephant herd, Amboseli National Park, Kenya (© Chase Dekker/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=World+Elephant+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250812_0400%22","title":"Wild, wise and wonderful","caption":"World Elephant Day","copyrightonly":"© Chase Dekker/Minden Pictures","desc":"Big ears, bigger hearts—elephants are more than just icons of the wild.

Matriarchs, the oldest females, can recall the locations of water sources from decades past, and they use that knowledge to lead their herds through tough times. Their social bonds run just as deep.

The surrounding tide pools come alive at low tide, revealing starfish, sea urchins and other marine life. The Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve, where these formations are found, is a quiet haven for wildlife established in 1984. The area is a seasonal stop for Atlantic puffins, which arrive between late May and August to breed and raise their chicks on the cliffs and grassy spaces. The park is also known for its seabird colonies, seal sightings and plant life adapted to harsh coastal conditions. It's a landscape that quietly speaks of time, tide and resilience.","date":"Aug. 7, 2025","bsTitle":"Carved by sea and time","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250807_MinganWonders%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c09ac244ac38f7177d48e43ce1cc644c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MinganWonders_EN-CA5648384478_tmb.jpg","title":"Monoliths of the Mingan Archipelago, Quebec","desc":"They may resemble ancient statues, but the monoliths of the Mingan Archipelago weren't carved by human hands.
