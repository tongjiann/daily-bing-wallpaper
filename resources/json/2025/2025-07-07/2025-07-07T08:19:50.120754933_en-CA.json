Asteroid Day highlights ongoing research into asteroids and the potential threats they pose. Started in 2015 and backed by the United Nations, this day marks the anniversary of the Tunguska event—a massive explosion that occurred in Siberia on June 30, 1908. This explosion flattened over 2,070 square kilometres of Siberian forest near the Tunguska River. The blast released energy equal to 10–15 megatons of trinitrotoluene (TNT), a standard measure of explosive force. Since then, craters like Arizona's Barringer, Quebec's Manicouagan and others have helped scientists study what happens when space rocks hit Earth.","date":"Jun. 30, 2025","bsTitle":"Rock-solid defence","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250630_WolfeCrater%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2aa24db444a79f175fb7be2aed97c34e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WolfeCrater_EN-CA2112068700_tmb.jpg","title":"Asteroid Day","desc":"Each scar on Earth from a meteorite impact tells a story—from the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs to the lesser-known craters that dot…","hash":"8ca6OUKrolw3z28PXWG9kYI824FypBw6MIw7Wik7HWY="}},{"startdate":"20250629","fullstartdate":"202506290400","enddate":"20250630","url":"/th?id=OHR.BandaIsland_EN-CA1920506603_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.BandaIsland_EN-CA1920506603","copyright":"Blue lagoon of Pulau Ay, Banda Islands, Indonesia (© fabio lamanna/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Banda+Islands&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250629_0400%22","title":"Where history gets spicy","caption":"International Day of the Tropics","copyrightonly":"© fabio lamanna/Alamy Stock Photo","desc":"Every June 29, the International Day of the Tropics shines a light on the equator-hugging zone where the sun sticks around, and climate conversations get real.

The festival is deeply rooted in the ideals of the hippie movement, the 1960s counterculture and the free festival spirit that sparked its early days. From David Bowie and Elton John to Metallica and Billie Eilish, Glastonbury's stages have hosted performances that have defined generations. This year's festival runs from today through June 29, with The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo topping the bill. Overlooking the event is Glastonbury Tor, pictured here, a hill crowned by the 14th-century St. Michael's Church Tower.
