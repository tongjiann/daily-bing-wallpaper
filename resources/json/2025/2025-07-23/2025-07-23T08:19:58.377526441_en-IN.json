Home to the pope and the spiritual centre of the Roman Catholic Church, this walled enclave is a blend of art, history and devotion. At its core stands St Peter's Basilica. Seen in the distance in today's image, this Renaissance masterpiece is built over what is believed to be the tomb of Saint Peter, the first Bishop of Rome. With its soaring dome dominating the skyline, the basilica is one of the largest churches in the world. Just beyond the basilica lies St Peter's Square, where thousands gather for papal blessings.","date":"Jul 23, 2025","bsTitle":"A country within a city","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250722_VaticanCity%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ed8c46bc76548b36d370f0753f579f4d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VaticanCity_EN-IN8408106347_tmb.jpg","title":"Vatican City, Rome, Italy","desc":"In the middle of Rome, Italy, lies an entire country of its own: Vatican City.

The national park, located in southwestern South Dakota, United States, features a dramatic terrain of eroded buttes, pinnacles and spires carved by millennia of wind and water. Spanning over 950 square kilometres, the park is divided into three main units: the North Unit, home to the visitor centre and scenic Badlands Loop Road; and the Stronghold and Palmer Creek units. The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about two centimetres per year, revealing colourful bands of volcanic ash, silt and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels and sabre-toothed cats.","date":"Jul 22, 2025","bsTitle":"Epic sunsets and ancient secrets","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250721_BadlandsSunset%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d42f0753fa16e2f63a4398ce0b52d85e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BadlandsSunset_EN-IN8164722915_tmb.jpg","title":"Badlands National Park, South Dakota, United States","desc":"As the sun sets over Badlands National Park, the landscape transforms into a stunning display of colour.

Situated more than 500 metres above sea level and spanning approximately 800 square kilometres, it is one of the largest areas in France dedicated to lavender cultivation. Lavender has flourished in Provence for centuries. The ancient Romans brought the plant to southern France, using it for bathing, cooking and healing. Today, 1,700 growers tend to do more than 200 square kilometres of these shrubs. They cultivate both traditional lavender—for perfumes and skincare—and lavandin, the longer-stemmed cousin often found in household cleaning products and air fresheners.
