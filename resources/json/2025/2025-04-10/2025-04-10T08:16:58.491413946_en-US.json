Their continuously growing teeth, with thick enamel giving them an orange hue, are essential tools for gnawing on trees—a behavior that maintains both their dental health and their environment.

The first National Library Week was celebrated in 1958 with the action slogan, 'Wake Up and Read!' This year, the annual National Library Week starts on April 6, which coincides with National Library Day. Some libraries will amaze us not only with their collection of books but also with their architecture.

Nature's color wheel has long been linked to myths and legends, from Norse gods to the Irish leprechaun's pot of gold. But beyond folklore, the science behind rainbows is just as compelling. The first real explanation came from Theodoric of Freiberg, a German physicist, in 1304. He discovered that rainbows form when sunlight enters a raindrop, bends, reflects inside, and then bends again as it exits. This process splits light into its colors, creating the spectrum we see. The classic 'ROYGBIV' (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) doesn't tell the whole story—rainbows contain millions of colors blended together.","date":"Apr 3, 2025","bsTitle":"The sky is the limit","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250403_SaguaroRainbow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"48a6a269b460e9b9c14890977d40d8c4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SaguaroRainbow_EN-US0296037572_tmb.jpg","title":"National Find a Rainbow Day","desc":"Have you ever spotted a rainbow and felt a little lucky?
