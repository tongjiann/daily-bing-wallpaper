Their mother keeps them safe while the father brings food. But as their eyes open and legs strengthen, the real fun begins. Sibling play is essential, shaping their hunting and social skills while keeping things entertaining. Wrestling, pouncing and even playful ambushes are all part of the training. They mimic each other's behaviours, test their boundaries and develop their cunning instincts as a team.","date":"10 Apr 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250410_LittleFoxes%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5b4e262859fd973be2dc30f8510229d3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LittleFoxes_ROW8690620947_tmb.jpg","title":"Red fox cubs near their den","desc":"The Red fox, the largest and most widespread species of fox, is found across the Northern Hemisphere.
