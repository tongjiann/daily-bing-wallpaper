Thanks to glacier-fed waters from the Rocky Mountains, the lake stays transparent even in the coldest months. The glacial meltwater carries fine sediment that scatters sunlight, while natural filtration through rocks keeps pollutants to a minimum.","date":"10 Jan 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250110_BubbleLake%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b72254540fe3452428baaf1f8fe508e6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BubbleLake_ROW6430486602_tmb.jpg","title":"Abraham Lake, Alberta, Canada","desc":"Ever heard of frozen bubbles?

This UNESCO World Heritage Site showcases advanced ancient engineering and remains a symbol of Chinese history and culture. Featuring steep trenches and watchtowers, parts of it were designed to keep invaders at bay. Hiking the Great Wall offers a unique glimpse into this historical landmark. The experience varies from well-preserved sections like Mutianyu to wild, unrestored parts such as Jiankou. Some steps are so high, they're more like steps on a ladder!
