The bright fishing sheds and homes weren't painted just for aesthetics; the hues once made buildings easier to spot during heavy fog or snowfall. These vivid colours also reflect the practical, resourceful life of the people who settled here. It is also one of the few places in North America where traditional Irish communal land use practices—such as shared meadows and garden plots—have been preserved in both form and function.","date":"1 Jul 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250701_CanadaDayFogo%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"13e676097111661877e1a89ed0ce13c7","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CanadaDayFogo_ROW4542871312_tmb.jpg","title":"Fishing village of Tilting, Fogo Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada","desc":"Tilting, a village on Fogo Island at Canada's eastern edge, was settled by Irish immigrants in the 18th century.
