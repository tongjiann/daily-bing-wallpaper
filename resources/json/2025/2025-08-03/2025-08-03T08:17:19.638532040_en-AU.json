These streamlined fish, marked by sharp V-shaped stripes, move in near-perfect unison. Their slow, deliberate spirals aren't random—they're an evolutionary strategy that offers both safety in numbers and an edge in hunting. Blackfin barracudas are found throughout tropical waters, from the Red Sea to the central Pacific. During the day, they gather in tight, coordinated groups near the reef, scattering at dusk to pursue prey.","date":"27 Jul 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250727_BlackfinBarracuda%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a1e278d9604e303c78da7661f455fe7e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BlackfinBarracuda_ROW4721072499_tmb.jpg","title":"Barracudas at Shark Reef, Ras Mohammed National Park, Sinai Peninsula, Egypt","desc":"Being surrounded by a shimmering spiral of silver—that's what it feels like to encounter a school of blackfin barracuda at Shark Reef in Ras…","hash":"7qYh7PCvhONanMwFzShmkaTClvrsm0IZygSOqUyUb/0="}},{"startdate":"20250726","fullstartdate":"202507260700","enddate":"20250727","url":"/th?id=OHR.MangroveTwilight_ROW4626130443_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.MangroveTwilight_ROW4626130443","copyright":"Mangrove trees at twilight, Walakiri Beach, island of Sumba, Indonesia (© Boonchet Ch./Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Mangrove&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250726_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Mangrove trees, Walakiri Beach, island of Sumba, Indonesia","copyrightonly":"© Boonchet Ch./Getty Images","desc":"As twilight descends on Walakiri Beach on the island of Sumba, Indonesia, the silhouettes of mangrove trees stand like sentinels in the tide—graceful, resilient and vital.

The city's distinctive palette of painted buildings—seen here from above—adds striking colour to neighbourhoods like Risco de San Juan, where homes are built into the hillsides. Founded in 1478, Las Palmas has a layered history shaped by Spanish colonisation, maritime trade and migration. Today, it is known for its subtropical desert climate—with average temperatures ranging from approximately 16°C in winter to 27°C in summer—and for Las Canteras Beach, one of the best urban beaches in Europe.","date":"25 Jul 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250725_LasPalmas%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b3cce81d6f6c0bff924cce6c650d4275","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LasPalmas_ROW4505111661_tmb.jpg","title":"Colourful houses of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain","desc":"If you're eager to explore faraway landscapes this summer, let us take you to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.

Though absent from the driest regions of western India, it thrives in diverse habitats—from lowland plains to elevations of about 2,000 metres—often favouring areas with tall palm trees, forest clearings, and cultivated landscapes. These compact birds are easily recognised by their short, curved bills, square tails and long wings. They are usually seen in small groups, huddled closely together on bare branches, power lines or pylons, occasionally preening one another. Agile in flight, they make aerial sallies to catch insects mid-air—sometimes holding the prey in their feet, tearing it apart with their beaks. While they typically feed on the wing, they may also return to a perch—or even land on the ground—to consume their catch or visit birdbaths.","date":"24 Jul 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250724_AshyWoodswallow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9fac238459803ef19680145afcf945fd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AshyWoodswallow_ROW0000420936_tmb.jpg","title":"Family of ashy woodswallows","desc":"The ashy woodswallow, also known as the ashy swallow-shrike, is a sociable bird found across South and Southeast Asia, including India…","hash":"/Af3Pj3LUyVH4CVJBMq11gJAR6QuBrc/skbVT1EzBWo="}},{"startdate":"20250723","fullstartdate":"202507230700","enddate":"20250724","url":"/th?id=OHR.VaticanCity_ROW9915711454_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.VaticanCity_ROW9915711454","copyright":"Vatican City with Saint Peter's Basilica, Rome, Italy (© RudyBalasko/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Vatican+City&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250723_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Vatican City, Rome, Italy","copyrightonly":"© RudyBalasko/Getty Images","desc":"In the middle of Rome, Italy, lies an entire country of its own: Vatican City.

Spanning over 98,160 hectares, the park is divided into three main units: the North Unit, home to the visitor centre and scenic Badlands Loop Road; and the Stronghold and Palmer Creek units. The park's dramatic terrain is the result of sedimentary rock layers eroding at a rate of about two centimetres per year, revealing colourful bands of volcanic ash, silt and clay. These formations are not only visually striking but also rich in fossils, including remains from the Oligocene Epoch (about 33.9 to 23 million years ago), such as ancient horses, camels and sabre-toothed cats.","date":"22 Jul 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250722_BadlandsSunset%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6902edfb928a48c618d65af821e5a350","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BadlandsSunset_ROW9806016673_tmb.jpg","title":"Badlands National Park, South Dakota, United States","desc":"As the sun sets over Badlands National Park, the landscape transforms into a stunning display of colour.
