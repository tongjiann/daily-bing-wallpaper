The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers. Light and shadow shift throughout the day, offering photographers and visitors various angles.

With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a dime—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 2 kilograms. Some, like the glass frog, are nearly transparent, while others are extremely poisonous. The golden poison frog, for example, carries enough toxin to take down ten humans. And if you think all frogs are swamp-dwellers, meet the desert rain frog, a round little amphibian that survives in dry conditions by absorbing moisture through its skin. Frogs play a crucial role in ecosystems by controlling insect populations and serving as prey for many predators. However, habitat loss, pollution and disease threaten many species.","date":"Apr 1, 2025","bsTitle":"From treetops to puddles","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250331_TicanFrog%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1cc7b01c355b39e8be6c7186c3b376da","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TicanFrog_EN-IN0941028255_tmb.jpg","title":"Tree frog, Costa Rica","desc":"Today's image features a tree frog.
