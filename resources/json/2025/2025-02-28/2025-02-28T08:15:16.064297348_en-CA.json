Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh up to 14 kilograms. Rams use their massive horns in intense head-butting contests. During these battles, males hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 32 kilometres per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, bighorn sheep can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive. In Canada, they inhabit the Rocky Mountains, including parts of British Columbia, Alberta and Yukon.","date":"Feb. 28, 2025","bsTitle":"Rocky relationship","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250228_NevadaBigHorns%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c08754bd9335419655a6c3129ff62ae4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NevadaBigHorns_EN-CA8281032097_tmb.jpg","title":"Bighorn sheep in Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada, United States","desc":"Nature's desert navigators—desert bighorn sheep—are a marvel to watch, effortlessly scaling cliffs and navigating rocky terrains with grace…","hash":"VVP52wrFHH9sZ2isSPBb5R17uokG6uirmV26T1yQCmk="}},{"startdate":"20250227","fullstartdate":"202502270500","enddate":"20250228","url":"/th?id=OHR.PolarCub_EN-CA8015894762_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.PolarCub_EN-CA8015894762","copyright":"Polar bear cub, Churchill, Manitoba, Canada (© Eric Baccega/NPL/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=International+Polar+Bear+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250227_0500%22","title":"Polar care","caption":"International Polar Bear Day","copyrightonly":"© Eric Baccega/NPL/Minden Pictures","desc":"Today we're heading north for International Polar Bear Day.

For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshipped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami, and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain. February 23 is celebrated as Mount Fuji Day (富士山の日) because the word 'Fujisan' can be interpreted as '2, 2, 3.' Although it's not a national holiday, people often take the opportunity to learn more about this majestic peak. It's also a day to reflect on the future of the mountain, and how it can be preserved for future generations. Every year, more than 300,000 people climb Mount Fuji, and over-tourism has become a real concern.","date":"Feb. 23, 2025","bsTitle":"Wind of Fuji, my souvenir from Edo","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250223_MtFujiSunrise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a96085d9e44980bdf1bdebb17e0ceb31","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MtFujiSunrise_EN-CA7120845966_tmb.jpg","title":"Mount Fuji Day","desc":"Around 100 kilometres southwest of Tokyo stands one of Japan's cultural icons: Mount Fuji.

Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure.
