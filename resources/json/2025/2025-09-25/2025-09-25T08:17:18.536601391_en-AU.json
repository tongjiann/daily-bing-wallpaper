These steep curves aren't just for the thrill—they're the only way to reach the pier below, where boats depart for the remote Blasket Islands.","date":"18 Sep 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250918_DunquinIreland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e91d3cb0006e7a5d9bf0b3b873499b81","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DunquinIreland_ROW8248282029_tmb.jpg","title":"Dunquin Pier, County Kerry, Ireland","desc":"This stunning view—where the sky meets the open waters of the Atlantic—is accessible only by foot.

They all played a role in one of the greatest environmental comebacks in history. Seen from 362 kilometres above, the Gulf Coast glows like a constellation—clusters of light scattered across the dark. But what truly makes this view possible can't be seen: the ozone layer, silently shielding everything below from the sun's ultraviolet rays. By the 1980s, that shield was thinning fast—damaged by chemicals once used in refrigeration and aerosol products. The solution? A global pact. The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, led to a swift phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. Today, satellites show that the hole over Antarctica is shrinking. Scientists believe it could be fully healed by mid-century.","date":"16 Sep 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250916_OzoneEarth%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"64bd6a72d0d34c9c2bf3fe1e567f5472","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OzoneEarth_ROW8045660515_tmb.jpg","title":"Nighttime view over the Gulf Coast","desc":"What do invisible gases, vintage hairspray and satellites have in common?
