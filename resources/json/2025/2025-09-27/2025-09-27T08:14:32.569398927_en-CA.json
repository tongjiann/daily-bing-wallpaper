The scale is astonishing: around 420,000 square metres packed with 14 grand beer tents, vast quantities of pretzels, sausages and ginger-bread hearts. Beyond the brews and brats, the fairground is a carnival in its own, teeming with roller coasters, games and thrill rides like the Wellenflug swing carousel, offering sweeping views of the festivities and Munich skyline. This year, the Munich celebration starts today and runs through 5 October.","date":"Sep. 20, 2025","bsTitle":"A tale of brews and views","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250920_OktoberfestSwing%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"bb8d1c1c180920bb60d3471ddf0b7480","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OktoberfestSwing_EN-CA4280103942_tmb.jpg","title":"Oktoberfest begins!","desc":"Every fall, Munich's Theresienwiese transforms into one of the world's largest folk festivals—Oktoberfest.

By the 1980s, that shield was thinning fast—damaged by chemicals once used in refrigeration and aerosol products. The solution? A global pact. The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, led to a swift phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. Today, satellites show that the hole over Antarctica is shrinking.
