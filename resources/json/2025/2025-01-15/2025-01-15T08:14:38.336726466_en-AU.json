On one side lies Petite Baie, once a haven for surfers, its shores still echoing tales of a time when humans and the ocean coexisted in harmony—until shark attacks imposed a solemn stillness. On the other side is a pebble beach, where the unrelenting waves sculpt the landscape. Here, the salty spray carried by the wind and the thunder of waves crashing against cliffs serve as constant reminders of nature's raw force.","date":"15 Jan 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250115_PointeDiable%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3dcacc1a124e068a7dc3a99fd0dff888","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PointeDiable_ROW0222638036_tmb.jpg","title":"Pointe du Diable, Saint-Pierre, Réunion Island","desc":"The Pointe du Diable, on the island of Réunion, is a striking intersection of nature's power and mystery.
