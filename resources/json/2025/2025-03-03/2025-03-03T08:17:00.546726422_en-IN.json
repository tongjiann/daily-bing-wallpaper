This day serves as a reminder that wildlife conservation is a shared responsibility. This year's theme is 'Wildlife Conservation Finance: Investing in People and Planet.' The events emphasise exchanging ideas, presenting solutions and diving into how innovative finance can help stop biodiversity loss and create a more sustainable future. Schools, conservation groups and wildlife parks host events such as nature walks, workshops, art contests, wildlife photography competitions and conservation talks to raise awareness. One species worth learning about is the southern yellow-billed hornbill, pictured here, a bird found throughout Southern Africa and commonly spotted in Kruger National Park in South Africa.","date":"Mar 3, 2025","bsTitle":"Wild about wildlife","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250302_HornbillPair%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7ac947493f931e0264f1e4f4f8b80b10","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HornbillPair_EN-IN8859837972_tmb.jpg","title":"World Wildlife Day","desc":"What better time to shine a spotlight on nature than on World Wildlife Day?

They're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba. Polar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves. It is important that we reduce our carbon footprints and contribute to the conservation of these amazing predators.","date":"Feb 27, 2025","bsTitle":"Polar care","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250226_PolarCub%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"941bb562fb1ea4d3f7ad7a2ce1e9bb4b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PolarCub_EN-IN9075237601_tmb.jpg","title":"Polar bear cub, Churchill, Manitoba, Canada","desc":"Polar bears are native to the Arctic and can be found in Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Svalbard.
