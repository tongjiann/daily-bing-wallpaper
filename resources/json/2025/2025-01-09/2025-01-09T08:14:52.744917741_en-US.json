This picturesque village, starring in today's image, showcases the rich traditions and unique language of Switzerland's Romansh-speaking communities. Its homes are adorned with sgraffiti—decorative designs etched into plaster—and colorful murals, both iconic art styles of the Engadin region. Dating back to 840 when it was first referred to as Ardezis, the village's history includes Steinsberg Castle, originally owned by the Bishop of Chur. Though destroyed during the Swabian War in 1499, the castle's tower has been restored multiple times and stands today as a proud reminder of its past. In 1975, Ardez was chosen as a Swiss model village for its exceptional preservation efforts, which have kept its historic charm intact.","date":"Jan 2, 2025","bsTitle":"The glistening village","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250102_ArdezSwitzerland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b43cf822fe39fe1d6be4bb3368e227c5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArdezSwitzerland_EN-US8405268165_tmb.jpg","title":"Ardez, Graubunden, Switzerland","desc":"Perched on a terrace above the Inn Valley at 4,790 feet, Ardez is a hidden gem in eastern Switzerland renowned for its deep cultural roots…","hash":"taKpfMrQqjl//GzMTGc+Kqd5NqTotNsBd4cIu2IRo7w="}},{"startdate":"20250101","fullstartdate":"202501010800","enddate":"20250102","url":"/th?id=OHR.PolarBearSwim_EN-US7610036047_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.PolarBearSwim_EN-US7610036047","copyright":"Polar bears at play in the Arctic (© Ondrej Prosicky/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=New+Year%27s+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220250101_0800%22","title":"Have an ice New Year's Day","caption":"Happy New Year!","copyrightonly":"© Ondrej Prosicky/Shutterstock","desc":"Happy New Year's Day!
