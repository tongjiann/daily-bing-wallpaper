At the heart of this vast, arid expanse is Sossusvlei, seen in today's image. A salt and clay pan surrounded by towering dunes, Sossusvlei tells a story of contrasts. Every 10 years or so, an extraordinary event occurs when the Tsauchab River floods the pan, transforming it into a stunning turquoise lake. From the adaptable gemsboks to the ingenious Namib desert beetle that drinks fog droplets that collect on its back, the Namib is brimming with stories of survival and resilience.","date":"Jan 9, 2025","bsTitle":"Shifting horizons","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250108_NamibiaDunes%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8e27042a00f41f8700943915a722076d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NamibiaDunes_EN-IN0592013391_tmb.jpg","title":"Sossusvlei sand dunes, Namib desert, Namibia","desc":"Picture a sea of shifting sand dunes glowing orange in the sunrise, stretching as far as the eye can see.

Over 25 metres tall and more than 80 metres wide, it holds the distinction of being the widest waterfall in Vietnam. Located over 270 kilometres north of Hanoi, the waterfalls have gradually worn away their crest over the years, inching upstream. For most of the year, they flow as two distinct cascades, but come summer, when the rains swell the river, they merge into one big fall. Even with better roads, easier public transport and drone videos showing off the jaw-dropping beauty of the falls, Bản Giốc remains refreshingly off the beaten path.
