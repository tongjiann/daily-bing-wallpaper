It wasn't until the 17th century that the umbrella, as we know it today, gained popularity in Europe, initially as a luxury item primarily for women. Fast-forward a few centuries, and these weather shields have become a staple in pop culture, too.

Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains.","date":"Feb 8, 2025","bsTitle":"Frozen in time","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250208_SnowySvaneti%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d2a7297695cc33edc58cf96287b8cc51","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SnowySvaneti_EN-US6546788330_tmb.jpg","title":"Medieval towers in Mestia, Upper Svaneti, Georgia","desc":"Winter turns Mestia's medieval towers into icy fortresses.
