Interestingly, the first St. Patrick's Day parade wasn't held in Ireland but in the United States. The earliest celebration was organised by Irish vicar Ricardo Artur in St. Augustine, Florida, in 1601. Canada's first St. Patrick's Day parade was held in Montreal in 1824. Here, the festival dates to the 17th century, when Irish immigrants brought their traditions to cities like Montreal and Toronto.
