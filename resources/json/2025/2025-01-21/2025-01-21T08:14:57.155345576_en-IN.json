Today's image features a Eurasian red squirrel, photographed in the Netherlands. The red squirrel can be found across Europe and Russia, from western Spain and Portugal all the way to eastern Siberia. Their diet mainly consists of nuts, fungi, seeds and berries, but they will occasionally eat birds' eggs. In addition to being the national mammal of Denmark, they also play a part in old Norse mythology. Ratatoskr is a red squirrel who scurries up and down Yggdrasil, the sacred tree, carrying messages and spreading gossip.","date":"Jan 21, 2025","bsTitle":"Feeling squirrely?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250120_DutchSquirrel%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b0e692094a607f005241a13c45301bdc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DutchSquirrel_EN-IN5567594638_tmb.jpg","title":"Eurasian red squirrel","desc":"What's that long, bushy tail scurrying across the branches?

Its iconic Moorish castle ruins and the 15th-century tower reflect its history as a medieval fortress. Fun fact: Many people thought the name Zahara de la Sierra came from azahar, the Arabic word for citrus blossom. However, studies suggest it actually comes from sahra, which means wild or barren land, reflecting the rocky hill where the village is located.

Although it's the smallest of the eight pelican species worldwide, it's still a large bird, measuring about 1.2 metres in length and having a wingspan of over 1.5 metres. The brown pelican is a piscivore, meaning its diet mainly consists of fish. Dixon Lanier Merritt's limerick famously begins, 'A wonderful bird is the pelican; his bill can hold more than his belly can,' and it's spot on—its pouch can store up to three times the volume of its stomach. This versatile feature acts as a scoop, a tool for cooling off during hot weather and a feeding trough for young pelicans. The brown pelican faced near extinction twice, first due to hunting and later from the impact of pesticides like DDT. Today, it's an Endangered Species Act and Environmental Protection Agency success story.","date":"Jan 17, 2025","bsTitle":"Pouch perfect","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250116_PelicanPortrait%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"be34681c8fae51e8222db9c312dcbbd2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PelicanPortrait_EN-IN4347458454_tmb.jpg","title":"Brown pelican, San Diego, California, United States","desc":"Today's image features the brown pelican, a bird that doesn't just fly but soars, spots and dives with unmatched precision.

This land owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago.
