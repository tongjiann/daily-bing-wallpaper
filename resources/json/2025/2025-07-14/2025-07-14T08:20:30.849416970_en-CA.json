With many shark species facing the threat of extinction, this day is all about appreciating their ancient legacy and learning how we can help keep them off the endangered list.","date":"Jul. 14, 2025","bsTitle":"Chasing waves, making tides","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250714_YoungShark%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c3188989d70ed341c4e07d050a7ca3c4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YoungShark_EN-CA4182495058_tmb.jpg","title":"Shark Awareness Day","desc":"Sharks have been around for over 400 million years—outlasting dinosaurs, surviving ice ages and weathering mass extinctions.
