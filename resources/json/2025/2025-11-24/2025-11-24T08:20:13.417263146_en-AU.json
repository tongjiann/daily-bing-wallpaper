Nestled in the northern Blue Ridge Mountains, it offers a glimpse into the region's rich biodiversity and historical heritage. The park's diverse ecosystems protect a variety of species, from towering oak and pine trees to black bears and white-tailed deer, while preserving the scenic beauty and wilderness that define this remarkable landscape. The park's major attraction is Skyline Drive, a 169-kilometre scenic road, offering vistas where clouds drift like thoughts across endless valleys. Trails—more than 800 kilometres of them—lead to places where waterfalls tumble and summits greet the horizon. Whether you're hiking, camping or stargazing, Shenandoah National Park provides an escape into nature.","date":"17 Nov 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251117_ShenandoahTrail%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"97e523b7750f97ad543a56c7e520f169","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ShenandoahTrail_ROW8425475363_tmb.jpg","title":"Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, United States","desc":"Today's image features Shenandoah National Park, in Virginia, United States, which serves as a sanctuary for the preservation of significant…","hash":"hG6JsK0o7orOaptmgUN955uBBDwz26vH6XFw47u/B1Y="}},{"startdate":"20251116","fullstartdate":"202511160800","enddate":"20251117","url":"/th?id=OHR.LyonTraboules_ROW8240471725_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.LyonTraboules_ROW8240471725","copyright":"A traboule in Lyon, France (© TPopova/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Traboules+of+Lyon&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251116_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"A traboule in Lyon, France","copyrightonly":"© TPopova/Getty Images","desc":"In Lyon, France, you don't just walk through the city—you glide through it.

These passages date back to the fourth century but became essential during the Renaissance, when silk traders used them to shuttle delicate fabrics safely from workshops to the river without braving the weather.
