Within it lies Shi Shi Beach, a serene stretch where the Pacific laps against sea stacks and sandy shores, as seen in today's image. Recognised as an International Biosphere Reserve, this national park features 900 kilometres of trails, where hikers can embark on a trek along the coast to see the beach's sea arch at Point of the Arches, an outcrop that has over 30 sea stacks, columns of rock rising from the beach.","date":"6 Nov 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241106_ShiShiBeach%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f11f3a242a0d19a60f4cbcea188681bc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ShiShiBeach_ROW0645631083_tmb.jpg","title":"Shi Shi Beach in Olympic National Park, Washington, USA","desc":"Olympic National Park in the United States, established in 1938, offers an escape into unspoiled wilderness.

Dove Cottage, Wordsworth's humble abode from 1799 to 1808, and the adjacent museum offer a dive into the poet's life. His later residence, Rydal Mount, continues the story just a short journey away. The heart of the village is St Oswald's Church, which dates to the 13th century. This landmark is Wordsworth's final resting place. Not far from the church, the aroma of the renowned Grasmere Gingerbread, made from a secret recipe, will set visitors' mouths watering.
