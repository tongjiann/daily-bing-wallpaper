As the country's first national park, it represents a conservation success story, where the once-endangered ibex now thrives alongside chamois, marmots and eagles. The landscape changes with elevation, featuring rolling meadows adorned with wildflowers and moss-covered rocks that give way to rugged peaks, the ideal challenge for climbers. Skirting the borders of Piedmont and the Aosta Valley, the park attracts those eager for wildlife photography, hiking and the serenity of alpine air. It is not only a refuge for animals but also a living museum of alpine culture.","date":"30 Oct 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241030_ValleAostaGranParadiso%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6d949a21d2c07d388c6aba7b1bf25892","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ValleAostaGranParadiso_ROW5529148067_tmb.jpg","title":"Gran Paradiso National Park, Italy","desc":"Established in 1922 to protect the dwindling population of ibex—any of several species of wild goat—Gran Paradiso National Park in northern…","hash":"ADcz0PuCm+DA5CPWhqKZ5iOic8l3igFNVIb4RXmxGTI="}},{"startdate":"20241029","fullstartdate":"202410290700","enddate":"20241030","url":"/th?id=OHR.GreatOwl_ROW5336296654_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.GreatOwl_ROW5336296654","copyright":"Great horned owl (© Mark Newman/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Great+horned+owl&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220241029_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Great horned owl","copyrightonly":"© Mark Newman/Getty Images","desc":"The Halloween season is upon us, so let's meet one of the holiday's icons: the great horned owl.
