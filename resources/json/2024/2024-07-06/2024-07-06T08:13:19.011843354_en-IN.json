The rectangular castle, constructed from both local and imported stone, is situated on a coastal ridge, strategically positioned to overlook a crucial crossing point over the River Conwy. The castle is divided into an Inner and an Outer Ward, fortified by eight large towers and two barbicans. A postern gate provides access to the river below, enabling resupply from the sea. The river below, the Conwy, is about 54 kilometres long and gets its name from the Welsh words 'cyn' (chief) and 'gwy' (water). Conwy Castle and the river are a timeless tribute to Wales's rich and turbulent past.","date":"Jul 6, 2024","bsTitle":"Rock the boat","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240705_ConwyRiver%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b5a54152b04f0bb3463ee52229954e84","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ConwyRiver_EN-IN8974486695_tmb.jpg","title":"Conwy Castle, Wales, UK","desc":"Conwy Castle was built between 1283 and 1287 by King Edward I during his conquest of Wales.
