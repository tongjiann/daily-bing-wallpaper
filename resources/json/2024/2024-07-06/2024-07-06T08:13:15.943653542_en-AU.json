Here, where the air is salty and earthy, the season unfolds in all its splendour. The gnarled beech trees stretch their branches towards the sky as if celebrating the change of time. Their leaves dance in the gentle breeze and fill the air with mysticism. Between moss-covered paths, the trees whisper past stories while the waves of the sea sing a song of renewal. Welcome to the Ghost Forest of Nienhagen, where summer spreads its fingers over the earth and envelops the soul in the infinite beauty of nature.","date":"29 Jun 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240629_NienhagenMecklenburg%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"afbbec79e2aa66060ba6e4371ea71484","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NienhagenMecklenburg_ROW3325679403_tmb.jpg","title":"Beech forest in Nienhagen, Germany","desc":"In Nienhagen, in the north of Germany's Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, lies a unique treasure: the Ghost Forest, a mixed forest of beech, oak and…","hash":"ePfycjzKvI0N4FyfA1CtBYcr878Qu6XRRQZ8DCa8fdU="}},{"startdate":"20240628","fullstartdate":"202406280700","enddate":"20240629","url":"/th?id=OHR.ChauseyIslands_ROW7325592526_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ChauseyIslands_ROW7325592526","copyright":"Chausey islands off the coast of Normandy, France (© Tuul & Bruno Morandi/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Chausey+islands&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240628_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Chausey Islands","copyrightonly":"© Tuul & Bruno Morandi/Getty Images","desc":"The Chausey Islands, located north of Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, form a Norman archipelago known for its unique tidal landscape.

Filippo Brunelleschi, an Italian architect and designer, engineered its dome, which is the largest brick dome ever constructed. It was built without the support of traditional wooden frameworks; its completion in 1436 was the final stage of the cathedral's construction.
