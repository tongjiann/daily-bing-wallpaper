Founded by ornithologist Frank Chapman as an eco-friendly twist on holiday hunting parties, this annual event replaced shotguns with binoculars. Since then, it has become one of the world's longest-running citizen science projects. Every year from December 14 to January 5, volunteers of all ages and birding skill levels come together to survey designated areas called 'circles.' Each circle has a diameter of approximately 24 kilometres, and participants count every bird they see or hear within it. The result is a colossal snapshot of bird diversity, with data collected from over 2,500 locations each season. It's a serious effort to track changes in bird populations, providing valuable data for scientists working to protect vulnerable species.","date":"Dec. 14, 2024","bsTitle":"'Hoo' said that?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241214_NorthernHawkOwl%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e4b17dc302173e9b282fce22e8fe7d0d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NorthernHawkOwl_EN-CA1011187644_tmb.jpg","title":"Christmas Bird Count turns 125","desc":"For 125 years, bird enthusiasts across North America have turned the holiday season into a festive, feathered affair with the Christmas Bird…","hash":"erwdb2da0MOGa6QSGuDtBGKR9SJzAZA7kzg8rMHqKvw="}},{"startdate":"20241213","fullstartdate":"202412130500","enddate":"20241214","url":"/th?id=OHR.ChristmasBudapest_EN-CA2975655898_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ChristmasBudapest_EN-CA2975655898","copyright":"Christmas market, St. Stephen's Basilica, Budapest, Hungary (© Calin Stan/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=St+Stephens+Basilica+Budapest&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220241213_0500%22","title":"Advent at the basilica","caption":"Christmas market, St. Stephen's Basilica, Budapest, Hungary","copyrightonly":"© Calin Stan/Shutterstock","desc":"As the holiday season kicks off, St. Stephen's Basilica becomes the dazzling centrepiece of one of Budapest's iconic Christmas markets.

After a gestation period of around 11 months, females give birth to a single baby—known as a chulengo—which is able to stand and walk within an hour of birth. Their diet, consisting of grasses, shrubs and lichens, enables them to flourish in harsh, mountainous terrain.
