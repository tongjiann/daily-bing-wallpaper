During a racquetball game, one of them exclaimed 'Aaarrr!' in response to an injury, and the concept of a day dedicated to pirate lingo was born. Initially an inside joke, Talk Like a Pirate Day gained popularity after the duo shared the idea with humourist Dave Barry in 2002, who promoted it in his syndicated column. Since then, it's become a day of fun and parodic celebration—people don pirate costumes, engage in pirate-themed activities, like the kid on the ship in today's image, and embrace mock pirate language.
