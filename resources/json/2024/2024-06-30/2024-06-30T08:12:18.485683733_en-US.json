Here, the cheers from football and cricket stadiums fill the air, and colorfully decorated rickshaws, recognized by UNESCO as an important example of cultural heritage, meander through the streets. Even by rickshaw, it might take you a while to reach your destination: Dhaka has been recognized as the world's slowest city.
