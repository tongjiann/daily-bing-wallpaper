This structure was built on the very spot where Buddha shared his first-ever sermon with his first five disciples. Originally built in 500 CE to replace an earlier monument commissioned by Emperor Ashoka in 249 BCE, it holds a legacy as rich as its carvings. With a solid base of 28 metres in diameter and a towering height of 43.6 metres, it merges stone and brick in a design that's both massive and intricate. The lower stonework boasts delicate floral carvings from the Gupta era, while its walls feature finely detailed depictions of humans, birds and inscriptions in the ancient Brahmi script. Although the stupa has been expanded six times over the centuries, the upper section remains unfinished. Standing before it, one can't help but marvel at the stories it holds.","date":"Dec 23, 2024","bsTitle":"Enlightened foundations","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241222_DhamekStupa%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"19bc9dab4ee8ccf8f91b2267850d904d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DhamekStupa_EN-IN0403888448_tmb.jpg","title":"Dhamek Stupa, Sarnath, Uttar Pradesh","desc":"Welcome to Sarnath, home of the celebrated marvel of Buddhism—Dhamek Stupa, featured in today's image.

Many renowned ballet companies present their rendition of this classic every year, including the New York City Ballet, the Boston Ballet and the English National Ballet, pictured here.
