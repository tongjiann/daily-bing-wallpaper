Set on Christmas Eve, it follows a young girl named Clara, who goes on an adventure with the Nutcracker Prince as they battle the evil Mouse King. Many renowned ballet companies present their rendition of this classic every year, including the New York City Ballet, the Boston Ballet, and the English National Ballet, pictured here.","date":"Dec 18, 2024","bsTitle":"Yule really love this ballet","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241218_NutcrackerBallet%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"e4df406f8ef42bd6549813c7a790d5ca","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NutcrackerBallet_EN-US8927830113_tmb.jpg","title":"English National Ballet performing 'The Nutcracker'","desc":"Every holiday season, as snow begins to fall and Christmas lights twinkle in the night, the story of 'The Nutcracker' comes to life on…","hash":"kq3lrLfaJSuDR1mO1jPOdiY9D6P/POmoO/++OwdI/zw="}},{"startdate":"20241217","fullstartdate":"202412170800","enddate":"20241218","url":"/th?id=OHR.ReinefjordenNorway_EN-US8636083241_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ReinefjordenNorway_EN-US8636083241","copyright":"Traditional red fishermen's cabins on the shore of Reinefjorden, Norway (© Pilat666/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Reine+Norway&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220241217_0800%22","title":"A shore to adore","caption":"Traditional red fishermen's cabins, Reine, Norway","copyrightonly":"© Pilat666/Getty Images","desc":"Step aside, regular beach houses—Reine's little red cabins are here to steal the show.

The village's waterfront is lined with the traditional fishermen's cabins called rorbu or rorbuer, which are mostly red in color, as seen in today's image. Once important to fishermen, these cabins have now become a popular pick for tourist rentals. In 1999, German painter Ingo Kühl set up a pop-up studio in a rorbu in Reine, where he painted scenes of the harbor framed by the towering mountain range.

Founded by ornithologist Frank Chapman as an eco-friendly twist on holiday hunting parties, this annual event replaced shotguns with binoculars. Since then, it has become one of the world's longest-running citizen science projects. Every year from December 14 to January 5, volunteers of all ages and birding skill levels come together to survey designated areas called 'circles.' Each circle has a 15-mile diameter, and participants count every bird they see or hear within it. The result is a colossal snapshot of bird diversity, with data collected from over 2,500 locations each season. It's a serious effort to track changes in bird populations, providing valuable data for scientists working to protect vulnerable species.","date":"Dec 14, 2024","bsTitle":"'Hoo' said that?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241214_NorthernHawkOwl%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"053192a2c8e28dd5596ab10950745f69","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NorthernHawkOwl_EN-US7592435350_tmb.jpg","title":"Christmas Bird Count turns 125","desc":"For 125 years, bird enthusiasts across North America have turned the holiday season into a festive, feathered affair with the Christmas Bird…","hash":"erwdb2da0MOGa6QSGuDtBGKR9SJzAZA7kzg8rMHqKvw="}},{"startdate":"20241213","fullstartdate":"202412130800","enddate":"20241214","url":"/th?id=OHR.ChristmasBudapest_EN-US0865695821_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ChristmasBudapest_EN-US0865695821","copyright":"Christmas market, St. Stephen's Basilica, Budapest, Hungary (© Calin Stan/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=St+Stephen%27s+Basilica+Budapest&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220241213_0800%22","title":"Advent at the basilica","caption":"Christmas market, St. Stephen's Basilica, Budapest, Hungary","copyrightonly":"© Calin Stan/Shutterstock","desc":"As the holiday season kicks off, St. Stephen's Basilica becomes the dazzling centerpiece of one of Budapest's iconic Christmas markets.
