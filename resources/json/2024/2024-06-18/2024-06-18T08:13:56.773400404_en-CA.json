Lupines were introduced to Iceland in the 1940s for soil erosion control due to their roots' soil-binding properties. The plant flourishes in sandy and salty soils and propagates rapidly, painting the countryside with hues of purple, pink and blue. Although some consider lupine to be an invasive species that threatens native plants, its arrival is welcomed by locals and tourists as a cherished characteristic of the summer landscape. You can find lupine fields in various regions, including Reykjavík and near the Skógafoss waterfall. These flowers also line the road leading to the Hellissandur Church in the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, as seen in today's image.","date":"Jun. 18, 2024","bsTitle":"'Lupin' into summer","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240618_LupinIceland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b63e35e6e7c9328f03f0e5f64ad09318","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LupinIceland_EN-CA8487496970_tmb.jpg","title":"Lupine fields, Snæfellsnes, Iceland","desc":"As spring gives way to summer in Iceland, the rugged landscape puts on a colourful parade.

The non-profit organisation Pollinator Partnership initiated Pollinator Week to raise awareness about the protection of these creatures. This celebration is now being joined by other programs and educational events around the country. Should we care? Absolutely!

They can survive in extremely dry conditions and can go without water for weeks, getting moisture from the food they eat. Moreover, gemsboks are adept runners, achieving speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour. Their distinguishing trait is their notably elongated, straight horns. Although both genders possess these formidable defences, the females' horns tend to be slightly longer and sleeker while the males' horns are thicker with broader bases.
