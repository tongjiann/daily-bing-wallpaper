As it turns out, they're not as dangerous as stories might lead you to believe. With more than 7,000 species, these animals have adapted to a wide range of environments—from deserts to rainforests. Now let's focus on the peculiar creature in today's image that's trekking across the arid landscape in Australia's Watarrka National Park. Its pace is deliberate, its skin a maze of spiky armour. Meet the thorny devil, also known as the thorny dragon or Moloch. With clever hydrophilic skin that channels moisture to its mouth, this reptile can hydrate just from the dew on its body. It can thrive in extreme desert conditions that would be inhospitable to many. So, the next time you spot a lizard, take a moment to appreciate these cool, scaly wonders of the animal kingdom.","date":"14 Aug 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240814_WatarrkaLizard%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"afebf4ce5c45227dc42e009449e70079","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WatarrkaLizard_ROW1623450590_tmb.jpg","title":"Thorny devil, Australia","desc":"From mythology to modern media, lizards have often been portrayed as scary reptiles.

The park's namesake, the Joshua tree, grows in a landscape covering 3,216 square kilometres. Despite their name, they are not really trees but rather a kind of succulent. Native to the southwest US and northern Mexico, they can grow up to 12 metres tall. Whether it's hiking through Hidden Valley, visiting the Cholla Cactus Garden or marvelling at Skull Rock, this national park has a lot to offer.
