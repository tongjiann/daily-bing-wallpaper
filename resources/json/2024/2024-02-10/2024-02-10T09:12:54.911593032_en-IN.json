From envelopes to lanterns, red is the dominant colour, symbolising luck and prosperity. The streets come alive with the rhythm of drums as the dragon dance takes centre stage. This is a bird's-eye view of the dragons—elongated puppets adorned with shimmering scales and animated by a team of dancers. The Lunar New Year is a popular time for families to reunite and is responsible for one of the largest annual human migrations in the world.
