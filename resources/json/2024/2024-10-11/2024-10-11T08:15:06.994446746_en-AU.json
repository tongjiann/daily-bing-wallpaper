Today's image features these highlands, which are in the northern part of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. They form a highland plateau that is part of the Appalachian Mountain chain. The region extends across the north of the counties of Inverness and Victoria and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Cabot Strait to the north and east, the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the north and west and Bras d'Or Lake to the south. The landscape is a stunning tapestry of broad, rolling hills interspersed with deep valleys and steep-walled river canyons. In the southern and western parts of the plateau, wide valleys shaped by glacial activity have created some of Cape Breton's most fertile agricultural land. Meanwhile, the interior and southern regions are blanketed in cool, damp deciduous forests, which transform into a vibrant display of autumn colours.","date":"11 Oct 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241011_CelticColours%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4a6e9b740e117aedb071bf5764693ad1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CelticColours_ROW3861704608_tmb.jpg","title":"Cape Breton Highlands, Nova Scotia, Canada","desc":"Welcome to the Cape Breton Highlands, where land and sea meet in a dramatic embrace.

Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells or man-made objects like bottles and cans.","date":"8 Oct 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241008_MototiOctopus%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5dc5b7717b1f9e361339371256c2bd98","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MototiOctopus_ROW8930489347_tmb.jpg","title":"Mototi octopus","desc":"Today's image features a creature with three hearts and the uncanny ability to change colour at will: the octopus.
