Diamond Beach is one of the most popular natural landmarks in the country. Located near the Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon, this unique beach gets its name from pieces of icebergs, broken off from glaciers, that wash ashore, resembling sparkling diamonds on the dark sand, which comes from eroded volcanic rocks. The contrast between the clear ice and black sand creates a surreal sight, especially when sunlight hits the ice, making it a must-visit destination along Iceland's south coast.","date":"24 Jan 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240124_IcelandBeach%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7cd7b7ad60128aaac5ffc8eb9a8bc614","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.IcelandBeach_ROW2410657863_tmb.jpg","title":"Diamond Beach, Iceland","desc":"From fjords and lava fields to ice caves and black sand beaches, like the one we see in today's image, Iceland is a treasure trove of…","hash":"/Vs8Xqn6t2Vn4MUK958+5qDBq18KOrl6qRHNoc+/h2E="}},{"startdate":"20240123","fullstartdate":"202401230800","enddate":"20240124","url":"/th?id=OHR.MaldivesAtolls_ROW2005051819_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.MaldivesAtolls_ROW2005051819","copyright":"Atolls in Indian Ocean, Maldives (© Amazing Aerial Premium/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Maldives&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240123_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Maldives","copyrightonly":"© Amazing Aerial Premium/Shutterstock","desc":"With serene sandy beaches and crystal-clear water, the island country of the Maldives is located to the southwest of Sri Lanka and India.

Macaroni penguins gather in foraging groups, but males can be aggressive towards each other. To show passivity and avoid a fight, individuals often ease through colonies with their heads tucked down to their chests.

This water carries precipitated limestone, which gradually accumulates and hardens over time, creating a series of rock barriers called tufa. These barriers form pools, with thin, lacy waterfalls leading from one 'lake' to another.
