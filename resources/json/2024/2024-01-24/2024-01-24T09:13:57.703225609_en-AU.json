This Eurasian wolf agrees, having been lulled to sleep by the serene surroundings of the Bavarian Forest National Park, or perhaps just the comfort in knowing they're an apex predator. This national park—Germany's first, established in 1970—comprises the largest area of forest in Central Europe. The softly rolling mountains, such as Great Rachel, Little Rachel and Little Arber, make for modest challenges for hikers who wish to wander through the abundant stands of Norway spruce. They aren't alone in the park though—the forest teems with life, including lynxes, bears, pygmy owls and Eurasian wolves. These wolves form a close-knit pack led by an alpha pair and have only recently been spotted regularly in the park after decades of being hunted out of Western Europe.","date":"17 Jan 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240117_SleepyWolf%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0a57fece496a9a234cef5a2de231ba61","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SleepyWolf_ROW5435740826_tmb.jpg","title":"Eurasian wolf","desc":"There aren't a lot of things that beat a cosy winter nap.

Over the years, the site has undergone significant transformations due to environmental changes and temperature fluctuation. Despite the threat of global warming, scientists remain optimistic about this landscape's preservation. The reason? Avalanches that descend from the Alps each winter provide new sources of snow and ice that should keep the cave sustained for years to come.","date":"15 Jan 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240115_IceChapel%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"46846fad7a4a9f180076ada145a42e3a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.IceChapel_ROW4612088880_tmb.jpg","title":"The Eiskapelle, Bavaria, Germany","desc":"The Eiskapelle, or Ice Chapel, is a natural cave tucked in the impressive Bavarian Alps around the Königssee—a lake located in southeastern…","hash":"7PekjZPt0Yyo/yY8KODmVbSgEa2Uu2bda5+KNdJncVA="}},{"startdate":"20240114","fullstartdate":"202401140800","enddate":"20240115","url":"/th?id=OHR.HokkaidoSwans_ROW4379782842_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.HokkaidoSwans_ROW4379782842","copyright":"Whooper swans in Lake Kussharo, Japan (© Darrell Gulin/DanitaDelimont.com)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Whooper+swans&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240114_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Whooper swans","copyrightonly":"© Darrell Gulin/DanitaDelimont.com","desc":"An elegant creature for a majestic setting.

Eurasian lynxes are primarily active at night, dawn and dusk, but can hunt during the day when they need to. These solitary hunters are renowned for their keen senses and remarkable agility.
