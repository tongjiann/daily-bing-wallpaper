Lighthouses have been keeping sailors safe almost as long as humans have been sailing the seas. Originally, lighthouses were powered by fires and oil lamps, requiring lighthouse keepers to maintain them. These days, however, most lighthouses have been automated and installed with electric light sources. In waters that are too deep or otherwise unsuitable to build a lighthouse, lightships have often been used. If you're lucky enough to live near a lighthouse, this weekend is the perfect time to pay it a visit.","date":"Aug 17, 2024","bsTitle":"Light the way","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240816_AlfanzinaLighthouse%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"bb6e576511ef22a0df051529923ecd21","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AlfanzinaLighthouse_EN-IN9099733197_tmb.jpg","title":"Alfanzina lighthouse, Algarve, Portugal","desc":"The lighthouse featured in today's image stands in Carvoeiro in the Algarve on the southern coast of Portugal.

Once known as the  White Cyclone, this beast underwent a transformation in 2019. The ride's wooden track was replaced with a steel track.

Since then, it has become a tradition for the sitting prime minister to raise the flag and deliver a national address on Independence Day. Over time, the focus of the celebration has shifted from solely nationalism to a broader appreciation of Indian culture and heritage. The Indian diaspora also celebrates this day worldwide, with parades and events, especially in areas with significant Indian populations. In New York and other US cities, it has come to be recognised as 'India Day.'
