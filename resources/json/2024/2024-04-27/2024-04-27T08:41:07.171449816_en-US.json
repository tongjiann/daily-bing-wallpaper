Lying on a narrow strip of land between two lochs, the site initially comprised 60 stones, although today only 36 remain. The exact purpose of the structure is still unknown, despite an excavation project at the site in 2008. In 1999, the Heart of Neolithic Orkney group of monuments, which includes the Ring of Brodgar, was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Bowling Ball Beach on the Mendocino Coast in California is named after the striking rock formations strewn across the shore. These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils. The answer, however, is quite simple: it is the forces of nature at play.","date":"Apr 14, 2024","bsTitle":"Rock 'n' bowl","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240414_BowlingBallCali%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e0116f6b0de9d4490506e664874b5144","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BowlingBallCali_EN-US3241530931_tmb.jpg","title":"Bowling Ball Beach in Mendocino County, California","desc":"Welcome to nature's bowling alley.
