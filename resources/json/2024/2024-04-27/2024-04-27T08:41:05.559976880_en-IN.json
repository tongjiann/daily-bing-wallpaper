Birds come in a wide range of shapes, sizes, colours and behaviours, making them one of the most diverse groups of animals on Earth—from imposing eagles to today's tiny snowy-winged star, a leucistic Anna's Hummingbird. These hummingbirds are typically vibrant in colour, but leucism means that they have decreased pigmentation, resulting in a paler appearance. Unlike albino birds, these hummingbirds retain some colour in their eyes. They are equipped with specialised adaptations like a long tongue for feeding on nectar from flowers. However, their diet is not limited to nectar alone; they also supplement their nutrition by consuming small insects and other arthropods. Their lighter plumage reduces protective camouflage, making them more vulnerable to predators such as hawks and feral cats.","date":"Apr 27, 2024","bsTitle":"Stop, it's hummer time!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240426_LeucisticHummingbird%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4e4c42288cb4ec546d2b5e0585381925","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LeucisticHummingbird_EN-IN0052515058_tmb.jpg","title":"Leucistic Anna's Hummingbird","desc":"Get your binoculars and field guide and head to a local park to spot a hummingbird!

These shrubs, known for their intricate network of stilt roots, play a crucial ecological role. Acting as 'green shields,' they provide essential protection against coastal erosion and help mitigate the potentially catastrophic effects of natural calamities. Having evolved unique mechanisms to absorb additional oxygen and expel salt, they endure conditions that are fatal to most flora. Their intricate salt filtration and robust roots enable them to withstand saltwater submersion and wave impact, while thriving in the low-oxygen mud of the intertidal zone's upper regions. Analysis of satellite imagery in 2014 has unveiled this hidden ecological treasure along Karnataka's coast. Despite mangroves being traditionally associated with India's east coast, Karnataka boasts a significant expanse of these vibrant saline-water ecosystems.","date":"Apr 26, 2024","bsTitle":"Between land and sea","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240425_MangroveIslands%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"353a106d95df4300a2afd7c09049b974","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MangroveIslands_EN-IN9832664879_tmb.jpg","title":"Mangrove islands near Kundapura, Karnataka","desc":"Pictured here are mangroves, resilient shrubs or trees, thriving in the challenging environments of coastal saline or brackish waters.

Despite their small size, Adélie penguins are sleek swimmers and can dive as deep as 175 metres in search of shrimp-like krill or fish. They are social animals which gather in small colonies for foraging, hunting and protection.
