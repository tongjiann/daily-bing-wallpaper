Skara Brae's ancient stone houses on the Orkney archipelago, pictured here, are one of the oldest Neolithic sites, occupied from roughly 3180 BCE to about 2500 BCE. Exposed by an 1850 storm, this prehistoric marvel is dubbed the 'Scottish Pompeii' due to its astonishing preservation—older than Stonehenge and even the Great Pyramids. It consists of a cluster of ten stone-built houses, connected by covered passageways.","date":"16 Jul 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240716_AncientOrkney%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1a8be53e2ad98bb94e384bd55805995e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AncientOrkney_ROW1650150678_tmb.jpg","title":"Skara Brae, Scotland","desc":"Nestled along the windswept coastline of the Orkney Islands in Scotland lies one of the most remarkable archaeological sites in Europe…","hash":"vyhR1PgoRXjNpR8TsO8KPoTVPHeRJPE12zcbGTt4Cts="}},{"startdate":"20240715","fullstartdate":"202407150700","enddate":"20240716","url":"/th?id=OHR.TateishiPark_ROW1515207137_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.TateishiPark_ROW1515207137","copyright":"Tateishi Park, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan (© blew_s/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Kanagawa+Prefecture+Japan&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240715_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Tateishi Park, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan","copyrightonly":"© blew_s/Shutterstock","desc":"Today, we're floating across the waves, following the ocean currents to Japan.

Most of the island of Lanzarote has treeless terrain covered with black-grey soil. A series of volcanic eruptions in the past, as recently as the 1700s, led to the unique colouration, and by 1775, farmers started growing crops in the new layer of nutrient-rich soil. This soil absorbs water and retains moisture for a longer period, and the ash keeps the temperature of the soil favourable for the growing grapes. The rows of holes surrounded by stones you see in our image were dug to protect young plants. Today, La Geria stands as a testament to innovation, where traditional cultivation counters arid conditions.

Measuring 38 to 40 centimetres long and weighing approximately 225 – 455 grams, this bird is a wonder of nature's design. Both male and female aracaris share the same dazzling appearance. These birds circle through the air in groups of 6 to 15 and at night, they snuggle together in tree cavities. Their song is as unique as their look—a sharp 'seek' or a whimsical 'pink,' sometimes a purring sound or even a raspy 'grhhrr.' Although deforestation and hunting pose threats to these birds, they are currently classified as a least-concern species. For now, collared aracaris remain a captivating sight, a splash of colour and a burst of life amidst the sprawling branches.","date":"10 Jul 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240710_CollaredAracari%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"65d92130f6208f55f0c7a38c19a3a481","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CollaredAracari_ROW9660042641_tmb.jpg","title":"Collared aracari","desc":"Black and yellow plumage, bright eyes and an oversized bill—meet the collared aracari, a fascinating tropical bird.
