Invented by the Indigenous peoples of Central and South America, hammocks were called 'Hamacas' and were originally woven for sleep and relaxation. Back then hammocks were made from the bark of trees, whereas now they can be made of various materials like cotton, nylon and canvas. They come in different shapes and sizes, like Nicaraguan hammocks, which are usually made of woven material with a wooden spreader bar. These sleeping swings have sailed across oceans as sailor beds, swung from the trees as forest dwellers' bedrooms and nowadays, add a touch of chill to hip outdoor retreats. They have health benefits, too; gentle rocking can improve your sleep and even relieve stress. So go ahead, jump into a hammock, and let it gently sway your worries away for a while.","date":"Jul 16, 2024","bsTitle":"Just 'hanging' out","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240715_HammockCamping%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"40e126d5cf7151e96771cce42b1433e6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HammockCamping_EN-IN2367011958_tmb.jpg","title":"A hammock in Central Florida, USA","desc":"Imagine swaying gently under a canopy of leaves, a soft breeze coaxing you into a serene slumber while you gaze at the stars above.
