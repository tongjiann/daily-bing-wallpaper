Fed by Tanner Creek, a tributary of the Columbia River, these waterfalls were named after a Native American village by members of the Mazama Mountaineering Club. At the end of a foot trail, visitors can see the spectacular two-tiered cascade that crashes down 106 metres into a pool below, which is the perfect place to take a dip and cool off. While you're swimming, don't forget to keep an eye out for the water ouzel—also known as the American dipper—a species of bird that calls the falls home. They can be spotted flying along the side of the stream and occasionally diving into the water.","date":"Mar 6, 2024","bsTitle":"Get your splash on","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240305_WahclellaFalls%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b4a3857581114be314d832835225411d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WahclellaFalls_EN-IN2266702818_tmb.jpg","title":"Wahclella Falls, Oregon, USA","desc":"At the end of a slot canyon in Oregon, there's something special awaiting hikers: the Wahclella Falls.

No, not like this Eurasian red squirrel; rather, that's the term for anyone born on leap day! A leap year is a calendar oddity that exists because Earth's orbit and our usual year count are slightly out of sync. Earth takes 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds, to revolve around the sun. To compensate for those extra 5 hours, February gets an extra day—leap day—every four years. The concept, dating back to the ancient Romans, was refined in the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. While the purpose of the day is to keep our year aligned with the solar calendar, it can also serve as an extra day to prepare for spring! Cultures worldwide mark leap days and years with unique customs. In Ireland and Britain, women propose to men, in Greece, marrying during a leap year is said to bring misfortune, and in France, a satirical newspaper is published.","date":"Feb 29, 2024","bsTitle":"Leaping through an extra day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240228_LeapingSquirrel%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"bf039dc694ae5a6e04fac3a8f8912cd4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LeapingSquirrel_EN-IN2638979538_tmb.jpg","title":"Leap Day","desc":"Are you a 'leapling?'
