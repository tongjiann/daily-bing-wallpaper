Rainbows occur when sunlight reflects and disperses through raindrops in the atmosphere. In today's image, we see a rainbow splashed across the majestic Kakshaal Too mountains in Kyrgyzstan. The Kakshaal Too range, with its rugged peaks and pristine valleys, is a fitting backdrop for the fleeting beauty of rainbows. A landlocked country in Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan is renowned for its stunning natural beauty and rich cultural heritage. The country's nomadic traditions, such as yurt camps, which are camps that consist of portable tents covered with skin or felt, and handmade textiles like Tush kyiz and Shyrdaks, provide a glimpse into its vibrant cultural tapestry.","date":"3 Apr 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240403_KyrgyzstanRainbow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d5d8c418e96bb50e2de711ead4d47dad","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KyrgyzstanRainbow_ROW5866972879_tmb.jpg","title":"Rainbow across the Kakshaal Too mountains, Kyrgyzstan","desc":"As Kermit the Frog once sang, 'Rainbows are visions, but only illusions, and rainbows have nothing to hide.'

The young leaves of these budding trees are significant to the Danish people, as they are harvested from April to May and used in cooking—particularly in salads. In the past, Europeans would often use the smooth bark of beech trees for writings texts. In fact, in the modern Dutch language, the term for 'book' directly translates as 'beech tree.' As the sun shines through the forest canopy, wild anemones brighten up the woodland with their white petals. These blooms, representing delicate beauty and sincerity, have even starred in masterpieces by artists such as Monet and Vincent van Gogh.","date":"2 Apr 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240402_JutlandSpring%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e30d87804c290e44babf8a42311f7ae0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JutlandSpring_ROW5635761299_tmb.jpg","title":"Beech trees and anemone wildflowers, Jutland, Denmark","desc":"Today's homepage takes us to Jutland, Denmark, where the arrival of spring showcases the green hues of the European beech, a national symbol…","hash":"S42x2nl3IJXQn80wFMBtbDkqB/23zXRaB4Kgbiq96xQ="}},{"startdate":"20240401","fullstartdate":"202404010700","enddate":"20240402","url":"/th?id=OHR.MontBlancGlacier_ROW4096751608_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.MontBlancGlacier_ROW4096751608","copyright":"Mer de Glace on the Mont Blanc massif, Chamonix, France (© Hagenmuller Jean-François/Hemis/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Mer+de+Glace&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240401_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Mer de Glace, Chamonix, France","copyrightonly":"© Hagenmuller Jean-François/Hemis/Alamy","desc":"Don't slip through the image of the day!

Their large stomachs have four chambers, which can make up to 30% of their body weight when full. These shaggy critters are so sedentary that algae grow on their coats. This symbiotic relationship provides them with a greenish hue, offering effective camouflage within the rainforest canopy. In 2021, these slow-moving creatures were declared national symbols in Costa Rica.

The 28-metre-tall white tower has guided sailors since its completion in 1809; it provides safe passage for ships on the Dublin-Holyhead-Liverpool route. When it was built, sperm whale oil was used to light the lamps; however, over the years, the mechanism has been upgraded to more advanced technology like LED bulbs and Fresnel lenses. Automated in 1984, the lighthouse continues to serve as a vital navigational aid, with its powerful beam shining up to 45 kilometres. As the sun sets and the sky fills with colours, the silhouette of the South Stack Lighthouse in the dusk makes for a stunning sight.

Revered for centuries by the Chinese, these fragile petals hold profound significance in their traditions, symbolising renewal, hope and the transient nature of life. There are various locations in China to view these blossoms, including Wuhan's East Lake Cherry Blossom Park, Shanghai's Gucun Park and Luxun Park, as well as Beijing's Yuyuantan Park. Cherry blossoms look similar to plum blossoms, but an easy way to distinguish between the two is to look at their petals.
