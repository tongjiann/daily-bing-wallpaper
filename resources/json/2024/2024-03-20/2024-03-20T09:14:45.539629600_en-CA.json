Construction of the castle began shortly after the Norman conquest in the 11th century, although it wasn't completed until the 14th century. From the castle, visitors can enjoy views of Cave Dale, a ravine that was carved by glacial meltwater over many years. In the limestone walls of the dale, there are caves and disused lead mines. From hidden caves to towering battlements, this corner of the Peak District is bursting with history and is just waiting to be explored.","date":"Mar. 20, 2024","bsTitle":"A gorge-ous walk","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240320_SpringCaveDale%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"af1e752611d4e92c9b68f10188cc0c81","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpringCaveDale_EN-CA2754665353_tmb.jpg","title":"Cave Dale and Peveril Castle, England","desc":"Peveril Castle was once a medieval fortress standing tall on a limestone outcrop.

Despite their carnivorous classification, pandas primarily consume bamboo, comprising up to 99% of their diet. The Chinese government built approximately 50 reserves for pandas. Fortunately, in 2016, the pandas were reclassified from an endangered to a vulnerable species.

This tasty-sounding constant is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately 3.14159. Every March 14, mathematics fans across the world get baking to mark Pi Day—a celebration of both the mathematical constant π and its delicious homophone, pie. It began in 1988, when physicist Larry Shaw connected the date (3/14) with the first three digits of this constant. Today, mathematicians and enthusiasts celebrate Pi Day with pie eating and pi reciting. Did you know that when your clock strikes 1:59 today, you will be three decimal places closer to the real value of pi? Pi is everywhere, even in nature. Pictured here is a bodhi tree in the shape of the pi symbol at Wat Phra Ngam, a temple in Ayutthaya, Thailand.
