From the castle, visitors can enjoy views of Cave Dale, a ravine that was carved by glacial meltwater over many years. In the limestone walls of the dale, there are caves and disused lead mines.

Despite their diverse origins within Neobatrachia, these tree-dwelling frogs share the common adaptation of inhabiting arboreal environments. They tend to be small and slender since their weight has to be supported by branches and twigs in their habitats. They can be recognised by the sticky discs on the tips of their fingers and toes, which help them cling to surfaces.

In captivity, their diet may include other items such as honey, yams, eggs, fish, shrub leaves, bananas or oranges with food tailored to their nutritional needs. Pandas were initially believed to adhere to a crepuscular pattern of activity, being active at dawn and dusk.
