This aerial photograph shows a flamboyance of lesser flamingos against the backdrop of Lake Magadi in Kenya. The lesser flamingo is one of the six species of flamingos and is known for its vibrant pink plumage and distinctive feeding behaviour. These birds prefer to eat near the surface of the water due to the way their beaks are built. They primarily inhabit African soda lakes that have a high carbonate concentration. Lake Magadi is one of the soda lakes that are brimming with cyanobacteria and algae, providing ample nourishment for the flamingos. The spectacle of thousands of these avian wonders congregating at the lake reveals the importance of these unique ecosystems.","date":"Mar 13, 2024","bsTitle":"Bird's-eye view","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240312_MagadiFlamingos%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2e0255aaefdabb8ade01c4327dd61039","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MagadiFlamingos_EN-IN1729964021_tmb.jpg","title":"Lake Magadi, Kenya","desc":"What an unearthly view!
