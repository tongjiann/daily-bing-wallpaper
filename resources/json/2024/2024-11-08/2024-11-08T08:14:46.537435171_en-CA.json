The towering presence of Mont Blanc, seen in this image, has left an indelible mark on literature, most notably on Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein.' The last Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, honouring Shelley's literary genius and the fascinating creature born from her imagination. 'Frankenstein' was conceived during a ghost story challenge. In 1816, an 18-year-old Shelley, along with fellow writers Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Polidori and Lord Byron, spent a stormy summer in Switzerland. There, she penned the tale of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. A pivotal scene in the novel takes place on a glacier near Mont Blanc, where Victor is confronted by his monstrous creation. This setting, with its surreal beauty and treacherous terrain, perfectly captures a sense of awe and terror.","date":"Oct. 25, 2024","bsTitle":"The heights of horror","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241025_MontBlancMassif%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"93f371c007318220bc241ebb6be6bf99","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MontBlancMassif_EN-CA4972012680_tmb.jpg","title":"Frankenstein Friday","desc":"Picture yourself at the highest peak in the Alps, where the air is crisp and the views are breathtaking.
