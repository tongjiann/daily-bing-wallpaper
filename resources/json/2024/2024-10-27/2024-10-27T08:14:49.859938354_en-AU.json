There are six living sloth species, divided into two types: three-toed sloths and two-toed sloths. The three-toed sloth, a laid-back, tree-loving mammal that's right at home in the tropical regions of South and Central America. They have short tails and three clawed toes on each limb, which help them cling onto branches with ease. Sloths are mainly leaf eaters, although they also snack on fruits, and tree sap to keep them going. To help them break down those tough, fibrous leaves, they have a special multi-chambered stomach. With their super slow metabolism, digestion takes its sweet time, and they don't need much food each day to get by. It's not just their stomachs that move at a leisurely pace; they're so slow-moving that algae often develop on their fur, giving a greenish tint, which handily also provides them camouflage.","date":"20 Oct 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241020_SmilingSloth%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"da581e835d78a4a1182e0f6b58adc360","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SmilingSloth_ROW2407860543_tmb.jpg","title":"Three-toed sloth in Costa Rica","desc":"The world's slowest mammal takes the spotlight in today's image.
