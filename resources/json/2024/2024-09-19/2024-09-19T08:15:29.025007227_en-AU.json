The 120-kilometre-long river intricately carves its way through valleys before converging with the Bow River in Calgary, at an elevation of 1,040 metres. Along the river's course is Elbow Falls—a series of cascading waterfalls—that creates a natural spectacle. In winter, the falls transform into an icy wonderland while summer brings a rush of whitewater, which is ideal for rafting, kayaking, fishing, hiking and other recreational activities.","date":"19 Sep 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240919_ElbowRiver%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6100c05a9da2a1d96f5f6ccf1e28b32f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ElbowRiver_ROW2359666399_tmb.jpg","title":"Milky Way over the Elbow River, Alberta, Canada","desc":"Amid the landscapes of southern Alberta in Canada, the Elbow River originates from Elbow Lake in the Canadian Rockies.

It was torn down during the tumultuous Meiji Restoration—the period that marked the return of imperial power in the country— but was rebuilt in 1933. The castle seen in today's image is a unique wooden reconstruction, a rarity among Japan's often concrete-rebuilt castles. This five-story structure, which includes a museum, offers a glimpse into feudal Japan while providing stunning views of the valley below. In addition to the castle, the city of Gujō is also famous for hosting the Gujō Odori, one of Japan's oldest dance festivals. Held annually from mid-July to early September, the festival sees locals and tourists alike dancing through the night in the castle town, preserving a tradition that dates back more than 400 years.","date":"18 Sep 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240918_GujoHachiman%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4ee4d2f01f1f0464506c4ef3927dadce","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GujoHachiman_ROW5500166549_tmb.jpg","title":"Gujō Hachiman Castle","desc":"In Japan's Gifu Prefecture, Gujō Hachiman Castle stands majestically on Hachiman Mountain.

These marsupials, smaller cousins of the kangaroo, are native to Australia and New Guinea. Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 45 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease.","date":"16 Sep 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240916_SunriseWallabies%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8843de9e645bcdafb9f5e3290f3fe0b1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SunriseWallabies_ROW4908014597_tmb.jpg","title":"Wallabies at sunrise, Australia","desc":"Amid the hues of dawn, captured in today's image, two wallabies stand alert in a field near the Adelaide River in Australia.

Because they must always surface, half of dolphins' brains are always active, meaning they never completely fall asleep.
