Today, landlubbers and seafarers alike put on their tricorn hats and hoist the Jolly Roger. The origin of this holiday goes back to a 1995 joke between two friends, John Baur and Mark Summers. During a racquetball game, one of them exclaimed 'Aaarrr!' in response to an injury, and the concept of a day dedicated to pirate lingo was born. Initially an inside joke, Talk Like a Pirate Day gained popularity after the duo shared the idea with humourist Dave Barry in 2002, who promoted it in his syndicated column. Since then, it's become a day of fun and parodic celebration—people don pirate costumes, engage in pirate-themed activities, like the kid on the ship in today's image, and embrace mock pirate language. Whether ye be a seasoned buccaneer or a greenhorn, today be for all to enjoy. So, batten down the hatches, set sail and remember: on this day, everyone can be a pirate.","date":"Sep. 19, 2024","bsTitle":"Avast, landlubbers!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240919_PiratePlayground%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"27cf0ac32c73f53a41193a14c39ebf59","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PiratePlayground_EN-CA5267288064_tmb.jpg","title":"International Talk Like a Pirate Day","desc":"Ahoy, mateys, it is International Talk Like a Pirate Day.

The castle seen in today's image is a unique wooden reconstruction, a rarity among Japan's often concrete-rebuilt castles. This five-story structure, which includes a museum, offers a glimpse into feudal Japan while providing stunning views of the valley below. In addition to the castle, the city of Gujō is also famous for hosting the Gujō Odori, one of Japan's oldest dance festivals.

During the festivities, mooncakes—round delicacies filled with sweet bean paste, salted egg yolks or lotus seeds—are often shared among friends and family.

Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease.","date":"Sep. 16, 2024","bsTitle":"Hoppily ever after","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240916_SunriseWallabies%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"765a701c9d9c293e9a2bff26a1c3dd88","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SunriseWallabies_EN-CA0408938056_tmb.jpg","title":"Wallabies at sunrise, Australia","desc":"Amid the hues of dawn, captured in today's image, two wallabies stand alert in a field near the Adelaide River in Australia.
