Here, the glacier Skaftafellsjökull, a branch of Vatnajökull—the second largest ice cap in Europe—stretches out like a frozen river, inviting visitors for guided hikes. Then there's Svartifoss, another waterfall in the park, fed by glacial meltwater.","date":"Sep 24, 2024","bsTitle":"Falling for this view?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240923_SkaftafellWaterfall%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7e9bc092c67372baa89474639d5898da","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SkaftafellWaterfall_EN-IN1234167290_tmb.jpg","title":"Skaftafell, Vatnajökull National Park, Iceland","desc":"In Iceland's Skaftafell, autumn isn't just a season—it's an experience.

Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. Weighing 13–45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban, conservation efforts and reintroduction programs have helped them rebound, and they are now found in about two-thirds of their historic habitat. Despite this success, some populations are still struggling, and sea otters are still an endangered species.","date":"Sep 23, 2024","bsTitle":"Otter-ly amazing","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240922_IcebergOtter%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"aa491cb42dd8c009f80f26e0d0921ce9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.IcebergOtter_EN-IN0982120054_tmb.jpg","title":"Sea otter in Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA","desc":"The otter featured in today's image was photographed in Prince William Sound, Alaska, United States.
