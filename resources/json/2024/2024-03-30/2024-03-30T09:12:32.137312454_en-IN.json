Despite being larger than many tree-dwelling mammals, three-toed sloths have adapted by reducing their muscle mass and size to thrive on treetops. Their large stomachs have four chambers, which can make up to 30% of their body weight when full. These shaggy critters are so sedentary that algae grow on their coats. This symbiotic relationship provides them with a greenish hue, offering effective camouflage within the rainforest canopy. In 2021, these slow-moving creatures were declared national symbols in Costa Rica. Then-President Carlos Alvarado signed the initiative into law in 2021 to emphasise the sloths' importance in the country's ecosystem.","date":"Mar 30, 2024","bsTitle":"Hello from the upside-down!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240329_SleepySloth%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"99ff9c55b23af13e7399a63880fb77cc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SleepySloth_EN-IN4281443663_tmb.jpg","title":"Brown-throated three-toed sloth","desc":"Costa Rica's lush forests are habitats for two sloth species: Hoffmann's two-toed sloth and the star of today's homepage, the brown-throated…","hash":"yI+9NF7vI3xKS/UwQVHwXrXMOiy443nriJXFUkvgFwg="}},{"startdate":"20240328","fullstartdate":"202403281830","enddate":"20240329","url":"/th?id=OHR.SouthStackLight_EN-IN3270278933_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.SouthStackLight_EN-IN3270278933","copyright":"South Stack Lighthouse at sunset, Holyhead, Wales, UK (© mariotlr/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=South+Stack+Lighthouse&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240328_1830%22","title":"High tides and bright lights","caption":"South Stack Lighthouse, Holyhead, Wales, UK","copyrightonly":"© mariotlr/Getty Images","desc":"Built on the rugged cliffs of Holy Island, Wales, the South Stack Lighthouse stands watch over the deep waters of the Irish Sea.

When it was built, sperm whale oil was used to light the lamps; however, over the years, the mechanism has been upgraded to more advanced technology like LED bulbs and Fresnel lenses. Automated in 1984, the lighthouse continues to serve as a vital navigational aid, with its powerful beam shining up to 44 kilometres. As the sun sets and the sky fills with colours, the silhouette of the South Stack Lighthouse in the dusk makes for a stunning sight.

Revered for centuries by the Chinese, these fragile petals hold profound significance in their traditions, symbolising renewal, hope and the transient nature of life. There are various locations in China to view these blossoms, including Wuhan's East Lake Cherry Blossom Park, Shanghai's Gucun Park and Luxun Park, as well as Beijing's Yuyuantan Park.
