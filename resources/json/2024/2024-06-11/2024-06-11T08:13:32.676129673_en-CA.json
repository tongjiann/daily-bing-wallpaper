The birds in today's image are in Bardia National Park in Nepal, but they're found across many other South Asian countries, from India and Bangladesh to Sri Lanka and Thailand. They catch their prey in mid-flight, returning to a perch where they can beat stinging insects to stun them, which makes them safe to eat. These birds are designed to hunt: their dazzling green plumage helps camouflage them in dappled jungle light, their curved beak is perfect for picking off insects with precision and their eyes can move individually, which makes them all the better for spotting bees.","date":"Jun. 4, 2024","bsTitle":"Birds of a feather…","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240604_ChestnutBeeEater%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"369f86b58702b3a758653b7f6997fdfa","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ChestnutBeeEater_EN-CA4730115773_tmb.jpg","title":"Chestnut-headed bee-eater, Bardia National Park, Nepal","desc":"It's not just a name.

The Everglades, spanning more than 6,100 square kilometres, is a lifeline to 36 federally protected and endangered wildlife, from the gentle manatee to the stealthy Florida panther. Here, the air thrums with the calls of over 350 bird species like limpkins and snail kites, while the waters teem with life too: fish, like snook and redfish and American crocodiles are all found here. Beyond its biodiversity, the park has earned global recognition, celebrated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve and a Wetland of International Importance.
