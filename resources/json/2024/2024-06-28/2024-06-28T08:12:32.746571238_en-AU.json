These animals were viewed as symbols of status and treasured as pets among royalty. Featured here are reticulated giraffes. Their coats feature large, polygonal-shaped spots that extend onto the lower legs, tail and face. Unfortunately, only around 16,000 reticulated giraffes remain in the wild, less than half of the approximately 36,000 recorded in the 1980s. Nevertheless, recent years have observed a promising trend in northern Kenya, where populations are rebounding thanks to places like the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. So, let's pledge to protect these creatures and their habitats.","date":"21 Jun 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240621_LewaGiraffe%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fc2d006f3a6edf7f7866cd8ff37bc134","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LewaGiraffe_ROW3316145572_tmb.jpg","title":"Reticulated giraffes","desc":"Giraffes have fascinated travellers from around the world for a long time.

Although some consider lupine to be an invasive species that threatens native plants, its arrival is welcomed by locals and tourists as a cherished characteristic of the summer landscape.

When the pups are a little older, their father takes time to play with them, teaching them survival skills they'll need in later life, like hunting and scavenging.

Thanks to an underwater canyon, enormous waves form off the coast, making it a surfers' paradise. Several surf records have been broken here, including the biggest wave ever surfed—an incredible 26 metres. Surfing has a long history; around 5,000 years ago in Peru, people used reed watercraft to surf the waves when they were out fishing. It was in pre-colonial Hawaii, however, that modern surfing was born. Here, people started to stand on their boards and to surf for fun.
