Over time, Banff's boundaries expanded, and it became part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks UNESCO World Heritage Site. Spanning over 6,600 square kilometres, this national park transforms into a snowy playground during the winter, attracting visitors eager to for skiing, snowshoeing, curling, skijoring and wildlife tours that offer plenty to explore. Despite the cold, life thrives in the park: it's home to a variety of wildlife, including elk, grizzly bears, mountain goats and wolves. Lodgepole pines and spruces also stand resilient against the harsh weather. Banff's flora and fauna are closely monitored, ensuring that this balance remains intact.","date":"Nov 11, 2024","bsTitle":"First flakes in the wilderness","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241110_Banff24%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0bcb5d717374f14656c8c5e58e9eff79","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Banff24_EN-IN9205670476_tmb.jpg","title":"Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada","desc":"Featured in today's image is a winter wonderland in Alberta, Canada.

The Caribbean flamingo is the largest species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries and along coastlines.

As the glaciers melt, the water carries fine sediments, creating a braided river system with a milky appearance that contrasts with the earthy tones of the volcanic terrain. Every spring and summer, the rivers swell with seasonal meltwater, continually shaping and reshaping the land. Aerial views reveal their intricate patterns, resembling complex artworks that interweave across the terrain toward the North Atlantic Ocean.
