Banff National Park is the perfect place for those seeking a refreshing escape. Established in 1885, it became the first national park in the country following the discovery of hot springs near Sulphur Mountain. Over time, Banff's boundaries expanded, and it became part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks UNESCO World Heritage Site. Spanning over 6,600 square kilometres, this national park transforms into a snowy playground during the winter, attracting visitors eager for skiing, snowshoeing, curling, skijoring and wildlife tours that offer plenty to explore. Despite the cold, life thrives in the park: it's home to a variety of wildlife, including elk, grizzly bears, mountain goats and wolves. Lodgepole pines and spruces also stand resilient against harsh weather. Banff's flora and fauna are closely monitored, ensuring that this balance remains intact.","date":"Nov. 11, 2024","bsTitle":"First flakes in the wilderness","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241111_Banff24%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ee8b65168e08821bb72c39ce1d0fea31","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Banff24_EN-CA4781010771_tmb.jpg","title":"Banff National Park, Alberta","desc":"Featured in today's image is a winter wonderland in Alberta.

The Caribbean flamingo is the largest flamingo species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries and along coastlines. Because of their pink colour, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills. However, their long necks and bent bills distinguish them from other wading birds like the great blue heron and wood stork.","date":"Nov. 10, 2024","bsTitle":"Flamboyance in flight","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241110_YucatanFlamingos%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"926d0cf7464f11b57e717d14308de294","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YucatanFlamingos_EN-CA4668702589_tmb.jpg","title":"Caribbean flamingos, Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico","desc":"Ever seen a group of flamingos take to the skies?

As the glaciers melt, the water carries fine sediments, creating a braided river system with a milky appearance that contrasts with the earthy tones of the volcanic terrain. Every spring and summer, the rivers swell with seasonal meltwater, continually shaping and reshaping the land. Aerial views reveal their intricate patterns, resembling complex artworks that interweave across the terrain toward the North Atlantic Ocean. The water in Iceland is more than just a beautiful sight; it plays a significant role in renewable energy. Its flow powers hydroelectric power stations, reinforcing Iceland's status as a leader in sustainable energy.","date":"Nov. 8, 2024","bsTitle":"From the land of fire and ice","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241108_GlacialRivers%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f0f2b751637df345b62f6387cc5601b9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GlacialRivers_EN-CA4120798939_tmb.jpg","title":"Glacial rivers, Iceland","desc":"Glacial rivers in 'the land of fire and ice'—Iceland—have shaped the landscape over thousands of years.
