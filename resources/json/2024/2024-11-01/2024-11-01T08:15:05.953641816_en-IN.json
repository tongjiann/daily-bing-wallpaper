Fast forward to 1604, and it was the fifth Guru, Guru Arjan, who placed the sacred Adi Granth within the temple, shaping its spiritual significance. Despite facing destruction multiple times at the hands of Mughal and Afghan invaders, the Sikhs showed resilience, rebuilding the temple each time.","date":"Oct 25, 2024","bsTitle":"A timeless glow","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241024_GoldenTempleIN%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"563b964d26fb51cdf9e308e788a0cf65","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GoldenTempleIN_EN-IN0200918572_tmb.jpg","title":"Golden Temple, Amritsar","desc":"Glistening like a jewel under the sun, the Golden Temple is not just a place of worship—it's an experience for the soul.

Winding through the park are over 11 kilometres of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat. The hardwood trees here are a haven for woodpeckers and other birds, while the soft soil provides ideal burrowing ground for tortoises.

Situated about 2.5 kilometres southeast of the modern-day town of Dendera, this temple complex is among the best preserved in the country. Once a thriving oasis along the Nile, it was home to thousands at its height, surrounded by a vast mudbrick wall that protected its sacred grounds. The Temple of Hathor, the crown jewel of Dendera, featured in today's image, immediately draws visitors' eyes. Its construction started around 54 BCE, under Ptolemy XII, with the majestic hypostyle hall added later during the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius. This temple doesn't have a grand colonnade or pylon gateway at its entrance. Instead, an unfinished stone wall surrounds an open courtyard with entrances leading to this massive hall. So, the complex you see today is truly a testament to centuries of history and evolution.
