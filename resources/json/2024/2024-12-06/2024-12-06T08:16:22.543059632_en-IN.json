The divine message was clear: build a sanctuary on this rock. Taking this angelic advice seriously, the bishop laid the foundations of what would eventually become the abbey that dominates the island today. Over the centuries, this UNESCO World Heritage Site grew in size and reputation, attracting monks, pilgrims and invaders alike.","date":"Nov 29, 2024","bsTitle":"An island of time and tide","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241128_MtStMichel%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0f61705817afb47a567f73f581554447","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MtStMichel_EN-IN3221435828_tmb.jpg","title":"Mont-Saint-Michel, Normandy, France","desc":"A tidal marvel and a slice of medieval life all rolled into one rocky outcrop—welcome to Mont-Saint-Michel in Normandy, northern France.
