Here, ancient buildings stand along the coastline of the Ligurian Sea, and life is filled with the hustle and bustle of fishermen. Vernazza got its name from the indigenous wine, 'Vernaccia,' meaning 'local' or 'ours.' One of the best-known monuments in the area is Doria Castle, built in the 15th century as a defensive fortress to protect the village from frequent pirate attacks. Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The cobblestone streets and absence of cars make it ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio. Did you know that this region inspired the 2021 animated movie 'Luca'? Vernazza is not just a place to visit; it's a piece of paradise reserved for those who seek the soul of Italy in its purest form.","date":"May 19, 2024","bsTitle":"Where history meets the sea","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240519_VernazzaItaly%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c756bc0c229ab93512fca2b53e172ff2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VernazzaItaly_EN-CA4571085041_tmb.jpg","title":"Vernazza, Cinque Terre, Liguria, Italy","desc":"Perched on the rugged cliffs of the Italian Riviera, Vernazza is a village in Cinque Terre, northwestern Italy.
