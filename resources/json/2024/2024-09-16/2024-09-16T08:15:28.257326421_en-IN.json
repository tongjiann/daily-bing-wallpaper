These marsupials, smaller cousins of the kangaroo, are native to Australia and New Guinea. Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease.","date":"Sep 16, 2024","bsTitle":"Hoppily ever after","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240915_SunriseWallabies%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"cfd36084202fdf07de93f274f51b57f6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SunriseWallabies_EN-IN8975505298_tmb.jpg","title":"Wallabies at sunrise, Australia","desc":"Amid the hues of dawn, captured in today's image, two wallabies stand alert in a field near the Adelaide River in Australia.

Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backward. Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects.","date":"Sep 15, 2024","bsTitle":"Humming along","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240914_SantaCruzHummer%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7c604ff8cb556e805aabe57a3d7e0e30","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SantaCruzHummer_EN-IN8727128444_tmb.jpg","title":"Anna's hummingbird, Santa Cruz, California, USA","desc":"Let's meet Anna's hummingbird, seen in today's image.
