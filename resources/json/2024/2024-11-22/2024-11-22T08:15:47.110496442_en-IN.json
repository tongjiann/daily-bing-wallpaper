Blind at birth, these little ones are vulnerable in the first few weeks of their lives and depend entirely on their mothers. At around eight weeks old, they meet the rest of the pride. This isn't just a casual interaction—it's an important moment for them to socialise and find their place in the group. During this time, they learn how to behave within the pride, which helps shape their roles as they grow up. After they hit six months, they begin to accompany adults on hunting trips, learning essential skills and tricks of the trade through real-life adventures.","date":"Nov 21, 2024","bsTitle":"A look over the shoulder","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241120_LionCubs%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6e49134466a648f8d2d4dece8ca0a524","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LionCubs_EN-IN6903529152_tmb.jpg","title":"Lion cubs, South Africa","desc":"Curious about what it's like to be a lion cub living in the wild?
