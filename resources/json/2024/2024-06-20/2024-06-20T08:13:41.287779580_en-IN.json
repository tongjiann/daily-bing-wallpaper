This phenomenon, known as the summer solstice, occurs when one of the Earth's poles is most inclined toward the sun. Today's image features the Kokino megalithic observatory, which is part of the Kokino archaeological site in North Macedonia. It is believed that Kokino observatory marked the position of the sun during summer and winter solstices, as well as the equinox, and consists of two platforms. A stone block on the upper platform of the observatory indicates the summer solstice sunrise direction when seen from a seat on the lower platform. So, when in North Macedonia, don't miss out on experiencing this ancient astronomical wonder!","date":"Jun 20, 2024","bsTitle":"Sunrise on the Solstice","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240619_KokinoMacedonia%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3a3677b39ca791cf3af49c0cc6f0809e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KokinoMacedonia_EN-IN6950788998_tmb.jpg","title":"Summer solstice","desc":"It's that time of year again—the daylight stretches long into the evening hours!

Their coats feature large, polygonal-shaped spots that extend onto the lower legs, tail and face. Unfortunately, only around 16,000 reticulated giraffes remain in the wild, less than half of the approximately 36,000 recorded in the 1980s. Nevertheless, recent years have observed a promising trend in northern Kenya, where populations are rebounding thanks to places like the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy.

Although some consider lupine to be an invasive species that threatens native plants, its arrival is welcomed by locals and tourists as a cherished characteristic of the summer landscape.
