Invented by the Indigenous peoples of Central and South America, hammocks were called 'Hamacas' and were originally woven for sleep and relaxation. Back then hammocks were made from the bark of trees, whereas now they can be made of various materials like cotton, nylon and canvas. They come in different shapes and sizes, like Nicaraguan hammocks, which are usually made of woven material with a wooden spreader bar. These sleeping swings have sailed across oceans as sailor beds, swung from the trees as forest dwellers' bedrooms and nowadays, add a touch of chill to hip outdoor retreats. They have health benefits, too; gentle rocking can improve your sleep and even relieve stress. So go ahead, jump into a hammock, and let it gently sway your worries away for a while.","date":"Jul 16, 2024","bsTitle":"Just 'hanging' out","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240715_HammockCamping%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"528e7e6ba060d4c0c5dc89370ec60e00","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HammockCamping_EN-IN2367011958_tmb.jpg","title":"A hammock in Central Florida, USA","desc":"Imagine swaying gently under a canopy of leaves, a soft breeze coaxing you into a serene slumber while you gaze at the stars above.

Today, it's not just a day—it's a call to action. Overpopulation stretches our planet's resources thin, urging us to confront urgent matters like family planning, an increase in waste and pollution or a lack of infrastructure. While metropolitan areas struggle with overcrowding, smaller places face the problem of decreasing population, leading to an imbalance. One such example is the Italian town of Gangi, Sicily, seen in today's image. This village had about 16,000 residents in the 1950s, but today, it is home to a little more than 6,000.

Measuring 38 to 40 centimetres long and tipping the scales at a mere 175 to 249 grams, this bird is a wonder of nature's design. Both male and female aracaris share the same dazzling appearance. These birds circle through the air in groups of 6 to 15, and at night, they snuggle together in tree cavities. Their song is as unique as their look—a sharp 'seek' or a whimsical 'pink,' sometimes a purring sound or even a raspy 'grhhrr.' Although deforestation and hunting pose threats to these birds, they are currently classified as a least-concern species. For now, collared aracaris remains a captivating sight, a splash of colour and a burst of life amidst the sprawling branches.","date":"Jul 10, 2024","bsTitle":"A 'toucan' of appreciation","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240709_CollaredAracari%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"575b94973ab88884541355f88a6b15f2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CollaredAracari_EN-IN5723111528_tmb.jpg","title":"Collared aracari","desc":"Black and yellow plumage, bright eyes and an oversized bill—meet the collared aracari, a fascinating tropical bird.
