Back then, the United Nations recognised the need to address the burgeoning issues tied to our global footprint. Thus, World Population Day was established in 1989. Today, it's not just a day—it's a call to action. Overpopulation stretches our planet's resources thin, urging us to confront urgent matters like family planning, an increase in waste and pollution or a lack of infrastructure. While metropolitan areas struggle with overcrowding, smaller places face the problem of decreasing population, leading to an imbalance. One such example is the Italian town of Gangi, Sicily, seen in today's image. This village had about 16,000 residents in the 1950s, but today, it is home to a little more than 6,000. Keen on revitalisation, Gangi attracts attention by gifting abandoned houses to those committed to their restoration.","date":"Jul. 11, 2024","bsTitle":"You are one in 8.1 billion","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240711_GangiSicily%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"dc948036b3ba7789f56dd1e9c24d3796","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GangiSicily_EN-CA3763946308_tmb.jpg","title":"World Population Day","desc":"In 1987, the world population reached the five-billion mark, a milestone so significant that it spawned an international observance: Five…","hash":"9yhK2Bhe00xMcsPXX9Vvpga3hhW9Nc5AbqvGX39vTK8="}},{"startdate":"20240710","fullstartdate":"202407100400","enddate":"20240711","url":"/th?id=OHR.CollaredAracari_EN-CA2465482704_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.CollaredAracari_EN-CA2465482704","copyright":"Collared aracari, Costa Rica (© Juan Carlos Vindas/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Collared+Aracari&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240710_0400%22","title":"A 'toucan' of appreciation","caption":"Collared aracari","copyrightonly":"© Juan Carlos Vindas/Getty Images","desc":"Black and yellow plumage, bright eyes and an oversized bill—meet the collared aracari, a fascinating tropical bird.

Measuring 38 to 41 centimetres long and tipping the scales at a mere 175 to 250 grams, this bird is a wonder of nature's design. Both male and female aracaris share the same dazzling appearance. These birds circle through the air in groups of 6 to 15, and at night, they snuggle together in tree cavities. Their song is as unique as their look—a sharp 'seek' or a whimsical 'pink,' sometimes a purring sound or even a raspy 'grhhrr.' Although deforestation and hunting pose threats to these birds, they are currently classified as a least-concern species. For now, collared aracaris remain a captivating sight, a splash of colour and a burst of life amidst the sprawling branches.","date":"Jul. 10, 2024","bsTitle":"A 'toucan' of appreciation","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240710_CollaredAracari%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"148189cc680818eac493410e83c1f19e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CollaredAracari_EN-CA2465482704_tmb.jpg","title":"Collared aracari","desc":"Black and yellow plumage, bright eyes and an oversized bill—meet the collared aracari, a fascinating tropical bird.
