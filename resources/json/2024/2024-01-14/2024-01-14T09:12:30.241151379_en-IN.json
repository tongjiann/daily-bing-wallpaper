One of the oldest known religious locations, the Devils Marbles, holds significant value for Aboriginal Australians as an ancient sacred site. Today, the Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve—also called Karlu Karlu—in the Northern Territory of Australia preserves the collection of giant, round, gravity-defying boulders. These rocks are composed of granite, and their peculiar shape is the result of millions of years of weathering and erosion. Lunar sample 14321, or 'Big Bertha,' has been dated to be approximately 4.46 billion years old—just a smidge younger than the Earth itself—and was recovered from the moon during the Apollo 14 mission. Scientists believe that the rock was a meteorite from Earth that hit the moon, and then we brought it all the way back, millions of years later.

This wonderland has towering castles, lanterns and intricate sculptures, all made of ice. In 2007, 'Romantic Feelings,' the world's largest snow sculpture at 35 metres in height, was created here in the shape of an Olympic-themed artwork. During the evenings, multicoloured lights illuminate the translucent sculptures, adding another layer of charm.

The bridge was painted International Orange—the golden adjective refers to the sun-reflecting waters below—and was opened to the public in 1937. It wasn't an easy vision to accomplish, especially as it was built during the Great Depression.
