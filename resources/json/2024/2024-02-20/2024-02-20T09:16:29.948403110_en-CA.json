At 636 metres, Kinder Scout stands tall as the highest point in the Peak District, its rugged moorlands and windswept plateaus having drawn adventurers and nature enthusiasts for generations. In 1932, this area was the stage for a historic mass trespass, where hundreds of people on foot protested for public access to these lands. This act of civil disobedience contributed to the passing of legislation that established national parks in the United Kingdom. The creation of the Peak District National Park ensured that these hills and valleys would be preserved for future generations to enjoy, marking a significant victory for public access and conservation efforts.","date":"Feb. 20, 2024","bsTitle":"A park for the people","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240220_PeakDistrictNP%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c37795235aa9ee020b8d9085e00aaccb","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PeakDistrictNP_EN-CA0602730401_tmb.jpg","title":"Kinder Scout, Peak District National Park, UK","desc":"Within the vast expanse of the Peak District National Park in the United Kingdom lies the Kinder Scout Nature Reserve, the site of a…","hash":"O/yoKlr+PjIu9fGwFEVq/CNo0qh85EoPl2A9yon31m4="}},{"startdate":"20240219","fullstartdate":"202402190500","enddate":"20240220","url":"/th?id=OHR.TajoRiver_EN-CA7817370984_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.TajoRiver_EN-CA7817370984","copyright":"Toledo, Spain (© Carlos Fernandez/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Toledo+Spain&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240219_0500%22","title":"Toledo's timeless tale","caption":"Toledo, Spain","copyrightonly":"© Carlos Fernandez/Getty Images","desc":"Toledo, a city situated in the Castilla-La Mancha region of Spain, is known for its unique geography.

Toledo has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1986, and its historical core is packed with mosques, synagogues and an impressive Gothic cathedral. The city has a strong Moorish cultural influence, left over from their arrival around the eighth century. The city was once home to the painter El Greco in the 16th century. He had an impact on Toledo, creating some of his most significant works, like the Assumption of the Virgin, which is considered one of his greatest masterpieces. Before the 16th century, Toledo's sword-making industry was known as one of Europe's finest.","date":"Feb. 19, 2024","bsTitle":"Toledo's timeless tale","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240219_TajoRiver%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6cda95ce45eeb995dda8b376f033f5d4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TajoRiver_EN-CA7817370984_tmb.jpg","title":"Toledo, Spain","desc":"Toledo, a city situated in the Castilla-La Mancha region of Spain, is known for its unique geography.
