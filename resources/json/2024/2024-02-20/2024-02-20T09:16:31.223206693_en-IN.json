At around 635 metres, Kinder Scout stands tall as the highest point in the Peak District, its rugged moorlands and windswept plateaus having drawn adventurers and nature enthusiasts for generations. In 1932, this area was the stage for a historic mass trespass, where hundreds of people on foot protested for public access to these lands. This act of civil disobedience contributed to the passing of legislation that established national parks in the United Kingdom. The creation of the Peak District National Park ensured that these hills and valleys would be preserved for future generations to enjoy, marking a significant victory for public access and conservation efforts.","date":"Feb 20, 2024","bsTitle":"A park for the people","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240219_PeakDistrictNP%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2fa759ad2dbc323ecb63fe3ecd7c4910","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PeakDistrictNP_EN-IN1834158436_tmb.jpg","title":"Kinder Scout, Peak District National Park, UK","desc":"Within the vast expanse of the Peak District National Park in the United Kingdom lies the Kinder Scout Nature Reserve, the site of a…","hash":"O/yoKlr+PjIu9fGwFEVq/CNo0qh85EoPl2A9yon31m4="}},{"startdate":"20240218","fullstartdate":"202402181830","enddate":"20240219","url":"/th?id=OHR.CarnavalTenerife_EN-IN9126594062_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.CarnavalTenerife_EN-IN9126594062","copyright":"Aerial view of colourful houses on a headland in Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife, Spain (© Marco Bottigelli/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Puerto+de+la+Cruz&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240218_1830%22","title":"Vibrant colours all year round!","caption":"Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife, Spain","copyrightonly":"© Marco Bottigelli/Getty Images","desc":"Sun-kissed beaches, colourful buildings, clear waters and rich history—there's something special going on in the city of Puerto de la Cruz.
