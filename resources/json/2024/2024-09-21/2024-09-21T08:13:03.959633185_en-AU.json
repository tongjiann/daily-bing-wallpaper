How long they can hold their breath depends on the species; some can go for 3 to 7 minutes, while others can stay submerged for up to 20 minutes. Because they must always surface, half of dolphins' brains are always active, meaning they never completely fall asleep. Despite being able to exist in an array of environments and water temperatures, dolphins are threatened by a variety of human activities, such as hunting, pollution and fishing.","date":"12 Sep 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240912_DolphinReunion%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2f347cc2e03e6beab8d4a8cbfe5c31de","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DolphinReunion_ROW4153666724_tmb.jpg","title":"Dolphin pod near Réunion island","desc":"Dolphins are highly intelligent and can be found all over the world in oceans, rivers and estuaries.

Built to ease the traffic jam on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal, the construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge began in February 1995. It is earthquake-resistant, designed to absorb shifting during a quake. Since its deck is not fixed to the pylons, it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Inaugurated on March 29, 1998, the bridge's opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India.","date":"10 Sep 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240910_BridgeLisbon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8ade4d690dbd8764f60e66da38292346","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BridgeLisbon_ROW2312230320_tmb.jpg","title":"Vasco da Gama Bridge, Lisbon","desc":"Today's image features the Vasco da Gama Bridge in Portugal, which looks like a sleek line cutting through Lisbon's skyline.

This historic structure is catalogued in the Base Mérimée, an architectural heritage database managed by the French Ministry of Culture. The original appearance of the cloister is now hard to envision due to extensive restorations carried out between 1900 and 1920. Originally, the cloister had two levels: the lower level, constructed in the early 11th century, featured vaulted galleries with semicircular arches and was free of ornamentation.

Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backwards.
