In this sanctuary, their vibrant red and green plumage with wings can reach over 90 centimetres. Their wings shine brightly against the expansive blue Brazilian sky and its impressive backdrop of towering red sandstone walls. Being one of the largest macaw species, they play a crucial role in dispersing seeds in their habitat, helping the regeneration of vegetation. Embark on a journey to Buraco das Araras and witness the graceful flight of these birds, a testament to the mesmerising beauty that our world so generously bestows.

The lower stretches of the river, known as the Tideway, extend up to Teddington Lock, reflecting its extensive tidal reach. From Oxford to its estuary, the river descends 55 metres. Although the Thames flows through some of the drier regions of mainland Britain and is heavily tapped for drinking water, its discharge is relatively low compared to its size.","date":"1 Sep 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240901_ThamesLondon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1bf39e1f0a55e32838238d29f422e2d3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ThamesLondon_ROW6580939487_tmb.jpg","title":"River Thames, England, United Kingdom","desc":"The River Thames, the longest river entirely in England, has more than 80 islands along its course.

Sadly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists whale sharks as endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss and climate change.

From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles and occasionally big mammals.
