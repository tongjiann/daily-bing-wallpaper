Coyote Gulch is a well-known backpacking destination offering towering vertical canyon walls, narrow slot canyons, domes, arches and natural bridges to visitors. The upper reaches of the gulch lie within the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument, while today's image showcases its lower sections in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (GCNRA). Established in 1972 and managed by the United States National Park Service, GCNRA is a conservation area that balances recreation and preservation. Unlike national parks that focus primarily on natural preservation, GCNRA offers a variety of facilities, including four public campgrounds, two small airports and several houseboat rental services, making it a popular destination for visitors.","date":"6 Oct 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241006_CoyoteGulch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d93d39492f49a09fc3d4a8c56f444d52","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CoyoteGulch_ROW8299172913_tmb.jpg","title":"Coyote Gulch, Glen Canyon Recreation Area, Utah","desc":"Framed by a natural arch in Coyote Gulch, Utah, United States, the vibrant golden cottonwood trees stand out against the colourful rock…","hash":"7EpujlhwfcdhMuPk8fW9WdcvH5Ikz6IRnvKj+Ilbgp8="}},{"startdate":"20241005","fullstartdate":"202410050700","enddate":"20241006","url":"/th?id=OHR.ElephantTeacher_ROW8011424345_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ElephantTeacher_ROW8011424345","copyright":"African elephants in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya (© Neil Bowman/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Tsavo+East+National+Park+Kenya&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220241005_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Tsavo East National Park, Kenya","copyrightonly":"© Neil Bowman/Minden Pictures","desc":"Amidst the landscapes of Kenya, Tsavo East National Park, seen in today's image, emerges as a sanctuary for nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts.

Here, African elephants roam in their natural splendour. These elephants, the largest land mammals, are celebrated for their extraordinary intelligence. Elephants are remarkable in guiding their young through essential skills such as finding water, selecting safe food and navigating complex social dynamics. Through gentle nudging, vocalisations and demonstrations, elephant mothers help their young survive in the wild.
