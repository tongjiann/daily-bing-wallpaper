It's Pollinator Week, celebrating the creatures which transport pollen to help plants reproduce. While some plants are self-pollinating, or pollinated by wind or water, the majority of them are fertilized with the help of bees, wasps, butterflies, moths, birds—like the green-crowned brilliant hummingbird in today's image—and even bats. The non-profit organization Pollinator Partnership initiated Pollinator Week to raise awareness about the protection of these creatures. This celebration is now being joined by other programs and educational events around the country. Should we care? Absolutely! From fruits and veggies to nuts, chocolate, or sugarcane, there are plenty of ingredients in our diet that are brought to us by pollinators.","date":"Jun 17, 2024","bsTitle":"Spread the pollen","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240617_HummingThistle%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"dc3056d211c2762763d08053dfaeabd2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HummingThistle_EN-US9897642087_tmb.jpg","title":"Pollinator Week","desc":"Let's celebrate the small heroes who help plants flourish!

Polynesians are believed to have brought their version of surfing to Hawaii, where modern surfing was born. Here, people started to stand on their boards and to surf for fun.
