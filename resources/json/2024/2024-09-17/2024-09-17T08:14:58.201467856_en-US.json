It's traditionally observed on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. Dating back more than 3,000 years to China's Shang Dynasty, this festival celebrates moon watching and the end of the harvest season. During the festivities, mooncakes—round delicacies filled with sweet bean paste, salted egg yolks, or lotus seeds—are often shared among friends and family. Lanterns of different shapes, sizes, and hues, symbolizing good fortune, illuminate the night. Asian communities across the world come together to showcase a mélange of cultural performances, heartfelt renditions of the Moon Festival's poetic tales.","date":"Sep 17, 2024","bsTitle":"Lanterns and mooncakes","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240917_MidAutumnSingapore%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"861775564e646aafd5b8bdbf991dbe12","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MidAutumnSingapore_EN-US5283310908_tmb.jpg","title":"Mid-Autumn Festival","desc":"For many Asian cultures, the point at which the moon reaches its fullest during the harvest season marks the Mid-Autumn Festival, also known…","hash":"O/DcASkICYuhZxWoOiylU0sYPAwdytbevDqVwdFlvGw="}},{"startdate":"20240916","fullstartdate":"202409160700","enddate":"20240917","url":"/th?id=OHR.SunriseWallabies_EN-US5210230008_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.SunriseWallabies_EN-US5210230008","copyright":"Wallabies at sunrise, Adelaide River, Northern Territory, Australia (© Jeremy Woodhouse/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Wallaby&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240916_0700%22","title":"Wallabies on the watch","caption":"Wallabies at sunrise, Australia","copyrightonly":"© Jeremy Woodhouse/Getty Images","desc":"Amid the hues of dawn, captured in today's image, two wallabies stand alert in a field near the Adelaide River in Australia's Northern Territory. These marsupials, smaller cousins of the kangaroo, are native to Australia and New Guinea. There are around 30 species of wallabies, including swamp, rock, and hare-wallabies. These sprightly mammals have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and deliver powerful kicks if threatened. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs' for safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range.","date":"Sep 16, 2024","bsTitle":"Wallabies on the watch","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240916_SunriseWallabies%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1e34eb2ce4ef5497f26c1865207e80ed","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SunriseWallabies_EN-US5210230008_tmb.jpg","title":"Wallabies at sunrise, Australia","desc":"Amid the hues of dawn, captured in today's image, two wallabies stand alert in a field near the Adelaide River in Australia's Northern…","hash":"bYncjbSZi/33hIy6rStdidL7QBITm1HyakR3OmzXUOg="}},{"startdate":"20240915","fullstartdate":"202409150700","enddate":"20240916","url":"/th?id=OHR.BalboaPark_EN-US5050015037_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.BalboaPark_EN-US5050015037","copyright":"Casa del Prado, Balboa Park, San Diego, California (© f11photo/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=National+Hispanic+Heritage+Month&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240915_0700%22","title":"Celebrating Hispanic heritage","caption":"National Hispanic Heritage Month","copyrightonly":"© f11photo/Getty Images","desc":"From today, National Hispanic Heritage Month unfurls its vibrant celebrations of Hispanic Americans' contributions to US culture and society.
