These animals were a key part of life for many Native American tribes, providing food, clothing and tools. Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States, featured in today's image. From the buffalo nickel to state flags, they are a deeply embedded symbol in American culture. Bison are North America's largest mammals, and they have been introduced as far away as Russia. While the bison has made a heroic recovery, the story isn't over. These animals still face challenges, including habitat loss and hunting.","date":"Nov 2, 2024","bsTitle":"Mighty and wild","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241101_BisonYellowstone%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"dd89fe55dfccd780d4f5c15e4a700664","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BisonYellowstone_EN-IN4855239793_tmb.jpg","title":"American bison","desc":"Once upon a time, in the boundless grasslands of North America, there roamed creatures of great strength and majesty—the American bison…","hash":"OTUuHZF4KfndzNci79UQYSEr9MdEQFgw/oKyrAiaAnk="}},{"startdate":"20241031","fullstartdate":"202410311830","enddate":"20241101","url":"/th?id=OHR.LencoisMaranhao_EN-IN6380365409_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.LencoisMaranhao_EN-IN6380365409","copyright":"Sunset in Lençóis Maranhenses National Park, Maranhão, Brazil (© thanosquest/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Lencois+Maranhenses+National+Park+Brazil&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220241031_1830%22","title":"Otherworldly beauty","caption":"Lençóis Maranhenses National Park, Brazil","copyrightonly":"© thanosquest/Shutterstock","desc":"Let's explore the breathtaking beauty of Lençóis Maranhenses National Park!

Regardless of the countless narratives and reasons behind the festivities, the central theme remains the triumph of good over evil. For many, Diwali is a homage to Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth, who is thought to be guided into the homes of devotees by the glow of lights and lamps. The day isn't just about lights and legends—it's also a time for enjoying moments with loved ones, exchanging gifts and sweets, indulging in delicious feasts and dressing up in new outfits.
