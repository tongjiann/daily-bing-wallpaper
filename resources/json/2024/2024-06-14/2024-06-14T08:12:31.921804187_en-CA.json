Built in 1914, the 15-metre-tall lighthouse embodies the enduring spirit of maritime Canada. Its beacon was first turned on in 1915. The current lighthouse replaced a wooden structure made in 1868 that was damaged by Hurricane Edna in 1954. The ground floor of the building served as a post office during the summer months until 2009, when Canada Post shut down the service, citing mould growth as a hazard. The lighthouse, now automated, attracts visitors eager to glimpse into Canada's seafaring past and feel the ocean's spray.","date":"Jun. 14, 2024","bsTitle":"Alone but never lonely","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240614_PeggysCove%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"741dc2865683706dc17377a2324ee39f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PeggysCove_EN-CA5369786988_tmb.jpg","title":"Peggys Point Lighthouse","desc":"Perched on a rugged granite outcropping, Peggys Point Lighthouse is a stoic guardian of Nova Scotia's coast.

Featured here is a group of gemsboks, a large antelope, reigning over the sprawling savannahs in southwestern Africa. Indigenous to the arid territories of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and parts of Zimbabwe, they thrive mainly within the Kalahari and Namib Deserts. They can survive in extremely dry conditions and can go without water for weeks, getting moisture from the food they eat. Moreover, gemsboks are adept runners, achieving speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour. Their distinguishing trait is their notably elongated, straight horns. Although both genders possess these formidable defences, the females' horns tend to be slightly longer and sleeker while the males' horns are thicker with broader bases. So, if you ever find yourself in the sandy plains of the Kalahari, keep an eye out for these desert gems.","date":"Jun. 11, 2024","bsTitle":"These antelopes are real gems","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240611_GemsbokBotswana%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b5cf72f2a4c67f0a7d0f4cbda3c9d001","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GemsbokBotswana_EN-CA0854561262_tmb.jpg","title":"A group of Southern gemsbok in the savannah, Botswana","desc":"Horns up, heads high!
