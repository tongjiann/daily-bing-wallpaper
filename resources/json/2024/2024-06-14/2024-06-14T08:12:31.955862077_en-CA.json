These gargantuan water bodies, after all, teem with wonders, from the tiniest plankton to the grandest whales like the humpbacks we see here. The oceans also produce almost half of the oxygen on our planet thanks to the photosynthesis of plankton—tiny plants, algae and bacteria. Moreover, they absorb a significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping mitigate the impacts of climate change caused by human activities.","date":"Jun. 7, 2024","bsTitle":"Waves of hope","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240607_HumpbackFamily%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"977efdc6459f8a8e696ed1122fdee213","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HumpbackFamily_EN-CA7093213035_tmb.jpg","title":"World Oceans Day","desc":"Today, let's embark on a watery adventure as we celebrate World Oceans Day.
