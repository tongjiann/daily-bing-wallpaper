For those seeking a more adventurous experience, this park has a lot to offer—from the mountains of the Peninsular Ranges and cactus-studded hills to slot canyons, badlands, and natural palm oases. In addition, as a designated International Dark Sky Park, it is an exceptional spot for stargazing. Beyond its natural wonders, the park, spanning over 600,000 acres, is also home to a rich cultural and historical legacy, including ancient pictographs, or rock paintings, from the Native American tribes that once lived here.","date":"Mar 15, 2024","bsTitle":"Where is this colorful desert?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240315_AnzaBorregoBloom%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1d41363064150f08518c5d945bfe7984","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AnzaBorregoBloom_EN-US1951730180_tmb.jpg","title":"Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, California","desc":"The first day of spring may be just days away, but the season's wildflowers at California's largest state park—Anza-Borrego Desert State…","hash":"uuxD+oOKZeZdQwu+EpP+px4TLlS37Xcv8QWoHrJnXJE="}},{"startdate":"20240314","fullstartdate":"202403140700","enddate":"20240315","url":"/th?id=OHR.AyutthayaTree_EN-US1871119120_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.AyutthayaTree_EN-US1871119120","copyright":"Wat Phra Ngam, Ayutthaya Historical Park, Thailand (© boonchai wedmakawand/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Pi+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240314_0700%22","title":"A piece of pi","caption":"Happy Pi Day!","copyrightonly":"© boonchai wedmakawand/Alamy","desc":"They say the only constant in life is change.

Every March 14, mathematics fans across the world get baking to mark Pi Day with a pie. It began in 1988, when physicist Larry Shaw connected the date (3/14) with the first three digits of π. Today, mathematicians and enthusiasts celebrate Pi Day with pie eating and pi reciting. Did you know that when your clock strikes 1:59 today, you will be three decimal places closer to the real value of pi? Pi is everywhere, even in nature. Pictured here is a bodhi tree which has grown over an arch into the shape of the pi symbol at Wat Phra Ngam, a temple in Ayutthaya, Thailand.
