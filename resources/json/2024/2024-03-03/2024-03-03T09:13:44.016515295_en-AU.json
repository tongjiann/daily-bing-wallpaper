Today's snapshot shows a leopard perched in the lofty branches of Kruger National Park, South Africa. Leopards are one of the five living species of the genus Panthera, which also includes lions, tigers, jaguars and snow leopards. The leopard’s rose-like markings are called rosettes, which are most frequently found on cat species, and are distinct from spots, like those seen on cheetahs. Rosettes can be seen on leopards, jaguars, young lions and even Bengal house cats. Leopards are known for their solitary lifestyle, especially males, who roam their territories almost entirely in seclusion. Today, these majestic animals are considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and their numbers are in decline globally. Through conservation efforts and events like World Wildlife Day, hopefully we can turn these trends around.","date":"3 Mar 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240303_KrugerLeopard%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b3b5993416e336bb5fb1444e4d32f02c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KrugerLeopard_ROW5518239475_tmb.jpg","title":"Leopard in a tree, Kruger National Park, South Africa","desc":"It's time to step into the wild!

Polar bears have gone by many names over the years, including white bear, ice bear and Greenland bear. Their scientific name, Ursus maritimus, is Latin for sea bear. These apex predators live and hunt on Arctic Sea ice. Their prey largely consists of seals, but they have been known to eat beluga whales, reindeer and other Arctic animals.
