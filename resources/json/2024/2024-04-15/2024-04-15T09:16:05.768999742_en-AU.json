European hedgehogs have a developed sense of smell, which allows them to experience the best fragrances of the season. These nocturnal creatures usually rest in their nests made of leaves and grass during the day, venturing out to explore their surroundings at night. But when an adventurous individual takes advantage of the daylight, they might sniff through the sea of yellow dandelion flowers, just like this spiky creature in today's image. As skilled hunters of insects and small animals, hedgehogs contribute to the diversity of this living ecosystem by consuming aphids, beetles and snails, helping to control populations of pests. So, if you come across one, respect its space and avoid scaring or disturbing it so that it can continue its own journey.","date":"8 Apr 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240408_HedgehogMeadow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d33d93d8c4e127bd6bf52a3951689e00","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HedgehogMeadow_ROW1328424022_tmb.jpg","title":"European hedgehog","desc":"A big hurray for spring for generously spreading delicious scents in the air, awakening our senses after the barren winter days.

They were hunted for their fur, and their 'nuisance' freshwater abodes were destroyed. However, these buck-toothed, paddle-tailed dam builders have been gaining new respect in recent years. Beavers are the second-largest rodents after capybaras. These animals have beneficial effects not only on water quality but also on land. With their iron-coated orange incisors, beavers fell trees, diligently constructing not just homes but habitats. Their dams create life-sustaining wetlands for countless species. The beavers' own lodges are masterpieces of security and comfort, with the entrance strategically submerged to deter predators and provide privacy.","date":"7 Apr 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240407_BeaverDenali%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"69ea3d918ddbdad4b0d804acfd1c8d36","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BeaverDenali_ROW1087795747_tmb.jpg","title":"North American beaver, Denali National Park, Alaska, USA","desc":"Meet the beaver: part-time lumberjack, full-time architect and all-around ecological superstar.
