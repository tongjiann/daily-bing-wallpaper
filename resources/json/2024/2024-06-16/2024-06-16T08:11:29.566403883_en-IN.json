The Killik River originates in the northern area of the Gates of the Arctic National Park and flows approximately 217 kilometres north until it meets the Colville River at Killik Bend. This is a region of the high arctic with few trees and lots of tundra and muskeg. The lower stretch of the river meanders slowly through lakes and permafrost terrain, while the upper portion remains nestled deep within the mountains. Numerous archaeological sites and traces of early Native American settlements and hunting activities are found throughout the region. The Rafters have access to two sections of the river, spanning 168 and 144 kilometres respectively, offering a rewarding 7 to 10-day journey.
