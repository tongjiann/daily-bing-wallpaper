Female red foxes need to stay in their dens with their young after giving birth, so males spend their time going out to bring her food. When the pups are a little older, their father takes time to play with them, teaching them survival skills they'll need in later life, like hunting and scavenging.

It was in pre-colonial Hawaii, however, that modern surfing was born. Here, people started to stand on their boards and to surf for fun. Historians believe that surfing made its way to the US in 1885, when three teenage Hawaiian princes surfed on redwood boards while on a break from boarding school in California.","date":"Jun 15, 2024","bsTitle":"Where there's a will, there's a wave","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240615_NazareWave%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"bcabbd1f99efd615c4db2d1b6b4a71e5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NazareWave_EN-US9510827848_tmb.jpg","title":"International Surfing Day","desc":"Today, everybody's hitting the waves for International Surfing Day!

They can survive in extremely dry conditions and can go without water for weeks, getting moisture from the food they eat. Moreover, gemsboks are adept runners, achieving speeds of up to 37 miles per hour. Their distinguishing trait is their notably elongated, straight horns. Although both genders possess these formidable defenses, the females' horns tend to be slightly longer and sleeker while the males' horns are thicker with broader bases.
