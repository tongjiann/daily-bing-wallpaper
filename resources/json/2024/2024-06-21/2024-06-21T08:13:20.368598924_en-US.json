Female red foxes need to stay in their dens with their young after giving birth, so males spend their time going out to bring her food. When the pups are a little older, their father takes time to play with them, teaching them survival skills they'll need in later life, like hunting and scavenging. The foxes seen here don't look red because they are melanistic, a genetic mutation causing an excess of dark pigmentation. This type of red fox is commonly called a silver fox. He might not get a card for his troubles but we're sure he is much appreciated.
