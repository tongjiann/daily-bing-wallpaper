Built in 1914, the 15-metre-tall lighthouse embodies the enduring spirit of maritime Canada. Its beacon was first turned on in 1915. The current lighthouse replaced a wooden structure made in 1868. The original wooden lighthouse became the lighthouse keeper's house until it was damaged by Hurricane Edna in 1954, when it was removed. The ground floor of the current lighthouse served as a post office during the summer months until 2009, when Canada Post shut down the service, citing mould growth as a hazard. The lighthouse, now automated, attracts visitors eager to glimpse into Canada's seafaring past and feel the ocean's spray.","date":"Jun 14, 2024","bsTitle":"Alone but never lonely","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240613_PeggysCove%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fa7294dc6c02815963bb988fce980fc9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PeggysCove_EN-IN6456343978_tmb.jpg","title":"Peggy's Cove Lighthouse, Canada","desc":"Perched on a rugged granite outcropping, Peggys Point Lighthouse is a stoic guardian of Nova Scotia's coast.

Indigenous to the arid territories of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and parts of Zimbabwe, they thrive mainly within the Kalahari and Namib Deserts. They can survive in extremely dry conditions and can go without water for weeks, getting moisture from the food they eat. Moreover, gemsboks are adept runners, achieving speeds of up to 59 kilometres per hour. Their distinguishing trait is their notably elongated, straight horns. Although both genders possess these formidable defences, the females' horns tend to be slightly longer and sleeker while the males' horns are thicker with broader bases. So, if you ever find yourself in the sandy plains of the Kalahari, keep an eye out for these desert gems.","date":"Jun 11, 2024","bsTitle":"These antelopes are real gems","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240610_GemsbokBotswana%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"64faada0a7ad8e66a12108d820cee763","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GemsbokBotswana_EN-IN8918609883_tmb.jpg","title":"A group of Southern gemsbok in the savannah, Botswana","desc":"Horns up, heads high!

This is a region of the high arctic with few trees and lots of tundra and muskeg. The lower stretch of the river meanders slowly through lakes and permafrost terrain, while the upper portion remains nestled deep within the mountains. Numerous archaeological sites and traces of early Native American settlements and hunting activities are found throughout the region.
