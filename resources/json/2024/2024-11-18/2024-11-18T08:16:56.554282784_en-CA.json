The town's rugged coastline, with its hidden rocky coves, has always posed a perilous challenge to sailors. Porthcawl lighthouse was built to help guide the increasing maritime traffic along the Bristol Channel. This cast-iron lighthouse was the last one in the United Kingdom to be powered by coal and gas. Although it was converted to electric power in 1997, the lighthouse still maintains its historical charm.","date":"Nov. 18, 2024","bsTitle":"Guiding the way since 1860","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241118_PorthcawlLighthouse%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3ed57827244e60eb06838a955d26223f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PorthcawlLighthouse_EN-CA7342147718_tmb.jpg","title":"Porthcawl lighthouse, Wales, United Kingdom","desc":"With waves crashing against its sturdy base and a stormy sea swirling around, this lighthouse in Porthcawl, Wales, has been standing…","hash":"7RnPRBisUkpGK2w9+/3zmsFOUm3a+eUqg5+tCv2aYPY="}},{"startdate":"20241117","fullstartdate":"202411170500","enddate":"20241118","url":"/th?id=OHR.RedStag_EN-CA7140488734_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.RedStag_EN-CA7140488734","copyright":"Red deer stag in Caledonian Forest, Glen Affric, Scottish Highlands (© Terry Whittaker/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Red+deer&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220241117_0500%22","title":"The 'hart' of the Highland","caption":"Red deer stag in Glen Affric, Scotland","copyrightonly":"© Terry Whittaker/Alamy","desc":"Striking appearance, strong presence and impressive antlers—meet the red deer, photographed in the ancient forests of Glen Affric, one of Scotland's most beautiful valleys.
