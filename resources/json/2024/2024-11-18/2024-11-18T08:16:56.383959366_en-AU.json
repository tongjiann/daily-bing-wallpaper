Over time, Banff's boundaries expanded, and it became part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks UNESCO World Heritage Site. Spanning over 660,000 hectares, this national park transforms into a snowy playground during the winter, attracting visitors eager to for skiing, snowshoeing, curling, skijoring and wildlife tours that offer plenty to explore. Despite the cold, life thrives in the park: it's home to a variety of wildlife, including elk, grizzly bears, mountain goats and wolves. Lodgepole pines and spruces also stand resilient against the harsh weather. Banff's flora and fauna are closely monitored, ensuring that this balance remains intact.","date":"11 Nov 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241111_Banff24%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5cd4093de698872e269eacb7b5fd97f3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Banff24_ROW2964082946_tmb.jpg","title":"Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada","desc":"Featured in today's image is a winter wonderland in Alberta, Canada.

The Caribbean flamingo is the largest species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries and along coastlines. Because of their pink colour, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills.
