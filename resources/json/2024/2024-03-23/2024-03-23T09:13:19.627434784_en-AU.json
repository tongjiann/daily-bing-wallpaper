Originating from the Latin words 'cumulus' meaning 'heaped' and 'nimbus' meaning 'rainstorm,' Cumulonimbus describes a towering cloud that develops vertically due to water vapour condensation, when the lower portion is propelled upward by strong uplifting air currents. These towering behemoths are not just sky-dwellers; they are the architects of thunderstorms and severe weather conditions. A wanderer in the sky, on their collapse, they undergo a transformative two-stage journey downstream. These celestial nomads boast lifetimes of six to twelve hours, while some lasting even longer.","date":"23 Mar 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240323_AmazonClouds%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"125f7f8cbcf4a74353529d9e7f762018","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AmazonClouds_ROW0640668790_tmb.jpg","title":"Large anvil clouds, Amazon, Brazil","desc":"'When clouds appear like rocks and towers, the Earth's refreshed with frequent showers'—there's a whisper of truth to this old proverb for…","hash":"Mjw7/hq214yD+G43aqAc4v6u07x4r6ZfVNs92vxlXfw="}},{"startdate":"20240322","fullstartdate":"202403220700","enddate":"20240323","url":"/th?id=OHR.WaikatoWater_ROW0303259467_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.WaikatoWater_ROW0303259467","copyright":"Blue Spring, Te Waihou Walkway, New Zealand (© Ian Beattie/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Waihou+river+New+Zealand&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240322_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Blue Spring, Te Waihou Walkway, New Zealand","copyrightonly":"© Ian Beattie/Alamy","desc":"Explore the Te Waihou Walkway while hiking along the Waihou River in New Zealand.

The water, radiating vivid shades of blue and green, has a temperature of 11 degrees Celsius all year round. With a robust flow rate of 42 metres per minute, it could fill a six-lane, 25-metre swimming pool in just over 12 minutes. Called 'Te Puna' in Maori, the spring is a natural taonga (treasure).

They can be recognised by the sticky discs on the tips of their fingers and toes, which help them cling to surfaces. There are over 8,000 species of tree frogs, typically found in Central America, Europe and Australia. The American green tree frog is the official state amphibian of both Louisiana and Georgia.
