The polar bears in today's image are in Kaktovik, a small Inupiat whaling community in Alaska, United States. The bears visit the village during autumn, attracted by unused remnants left on the streets by whale hunters. Polar bears exhibit remarkable mobility, traversing areas ranging from as small as 3,500 square kilometres to as expansive as 38,000 square kilometres in a year. Unlike some other bears, most polar bears remain active throughout the year. Hibernation is exclusive to pregnant females. Non-hibernating individuals maintain a regular 24-hour cycle, persisting even in conditions of continuous darkness or sunlight, although cycles shorter than a day are more prevalent during prolonged darkness.","date":"Feb 27, 2024","bsTitle":"An ice day to play","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240226_PolarBearCubs%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b7687473a4ced80b44a417f9ad989799","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PolarBearCubs_EN-IN7268694911_tmb.jpg","title":"Polar bear cubs","desc":"These apex predators live and hunt on Arctic sea ice.
