Civilisations have gazed at the sky for millennia, contemplating the origins and mysteries of the moon. The advent of space exploration transformed it into the target of numerous missions. Apollo 11, the pioneering space mission that first landed humans on the moon, was launched on July 16, 1969. It culminated in the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin taking the first steps on the moon on July 20, 1969. Moon missions have found no signs of life, but they could be a future site for human colonisation. The discovery of water ice, especially in the dark craters at the poles, makes it more hospitable for potential settlers. So, until you can live there, keep dreaming under the same moon that has captivated humanity since time immemorial.","date":"20 Jul 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240720_MineralMoon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"76aaeb54f117f4550e918edfbb5b3b59","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MineralMoon_ROW8248353552_tmb.jpg","title":"The Moon","desc":"The moon, Earth's only natural satellite, is a symbol for human curiosity and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.

Most of the island of Lanzarote has treeless terrain covered with black-grey soil. A series of volcanic eruptions in the past, as recently as the 1700s, led to the unique colouration, and by 1775, farmers started growing crops in the new layer of nutrient-rich soil. This soil absorbs water and retains moisture for a longer period, and the ash keeps the temperature of the soil favourable for the growing grapes. The rows of holes surrounded by stones you see in our image were dug to protect young plants. Today, La Geria stands as a testament to innovation, where traditional cultivation counters arid conditions. A wine connoisseur would be privileged to taste the story of this island through sips of La Geria's fine wine, fermented from Malvasia grapes.","date":"14 Jul 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240714_LaGeriaLanzarote%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7e3544b6ecd2aaf2d45d0ff3c3dce619","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LaGeriaLanzarote_ROW1086932756_tmb.jpg","title":"La Geria wine region, Lanzarote, Canary Islands, Spain","desc":"Surrounded by rugged, dark-hued landscapes, La Geria wine region stands as a viticultural marvel.
