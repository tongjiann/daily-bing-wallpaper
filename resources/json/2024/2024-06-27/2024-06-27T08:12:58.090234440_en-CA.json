Let the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore transport you through time. More than just a church, this Gothic structure, with its red-tiled dome, is steeped in centuries of history. Built over an older cathedral dedicated to Santa Reparata, construction began in 1296 under the supervision of architect Arnolfo di Cambio. Filippo Brunelleschi, an Italian architect and designer, engineered its dome, which is the largest brick dome ever constructed. It was built without the support of traditional wooden frameworks; its completion in 1436 was the final stage of the cathedral's construction.","date":"Jun. 27, 2024","bsTitle":"Dome sweet dome","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240627_FlorenceDuomo%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8bb90cab6ca3ef18ae3d5b014e4b51e7","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FlorenceDuomo_EN-CA9972074175_tmb.jpg","title":"Duomo Santa Maria del Fiore, Florence","desc":"Welcome to Florence, the cradle of the Renaissance!
