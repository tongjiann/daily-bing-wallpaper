Among these, Pont Neuf, seen in this image, is perhaps one of the most widely recognised. Completed in 1607 during the reign of Henry IV, this bridge's elegant arches and stone sculptures have witnessed centuries of Parisian history, enduring revolutions and transformations. Pont Neuf, which translates to 'New Bridge,' is, ironically, the oldest standing bridge over the Seine. It has been designated as a 'monument historique' by the French Ministry of Culture since 1889.

Hammocks were called 'Hamacas' and were originally woven for sleep and relaxation. Back then hammocks were made from the bark of trees, whereas now they can be made of various materials like cotton, nylon and canvas. They come in different shapes and sizes, like Nicaraguan hammocks, which are usually made of woven material with a wooden spreader bar. These sleeping swings have sailed across oceans as sailor beds, swung from the trees as forest dwellers' bedrooms, and nowadays, add a touch of chill to hip outdoor retreats. They have health benefits, too; gentle rocking can improve your sleep and even relieve stress. So go ahead, jump into a hammock and let it gently sway your worries away for a while.","date":"22 Jul 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240722_HammockCamping%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"497fa0d9f0bc2f8e688252450d406970","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HammockCamping_ROW2610450253_tmb.jpg","title":"Hammock camping","desc":"Imagine swaying gently under a canopy of leaves, a soft breeze coaxing you into a serene slumber while you gaze at the stars above.

Civilisations have gazed at the sky for millennia, contemplating the origins and mysteries of the moon. The advent of space exploration transformed it into the target of numerous missions. Apollo 11, the pioneering space mission that first landed humans on the moon, was launched on July 16, 1969. It culminated in the astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin taking the first steps on the moon on July 20, 1969. Moon missions have found no signs of life, but they could be a future site for human colonisation. The discovery of water ice, especially in the dark craters at the poles, makes it more hospitable for potential settlers.
