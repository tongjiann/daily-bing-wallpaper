However, on the island of Sicily lies a less famous gem—Modica. It's a city that has risen from the rubble of an earthquake in 1693 to become an architectural wonderland of Baroque-style buildings. With fewer than 60,000 inhabitants, this UNESCO World Heritage Site boasts cobbled lanes, echoing with powerful footprints—from prehistoric tribes to the ancient Greeks and Romans to the medieval Arabs and Normans. Landmarks like the San Giorgio Cathedral and San Pietro Church awe visitors with their grandeur, and Modica's recognised chocolate, crafted with Aztec-inspired techniques, tempts the palates of food enthusiasts.

Nature seems to come to life when these insects are flapping their wings, filling the air with their elegant shapes. Found everywhere on Earth except Antarctica, there are over 18,000 species of butterflies. Starting life as caterpillars, they undergo a metamorphosis to become fully formed butterflies.

Polar bears have gone by many names over the years, including white bear, ice bear and Greenland bear. Their scientific name, Ursus maritimus, is Latin for sea bear. These apex predators live and hunt on Arctic Sea ice. Their prey largely consists of seals, but they have been known to eat beluga whales, reindeer and other Arctic animals.
