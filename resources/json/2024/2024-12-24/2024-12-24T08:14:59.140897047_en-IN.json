One of the prettiest places in the Lofoten Islands of Norway, Reine is a fishing village with a population of around 300. A trading post since 1775, it has evolved from a commercial hub to become a sought-after tourist destination. The village's waterfront is lined with the traditional fishermen's cabins called rorbu or rorbuer, which are mostly red in colour, as seen in today's image. Once important to fishermen, these cabins have now become a popular pick for tourist rentals. In 1999, German painter Ingo Kühl set up a pop-up studio in a rorbu in Reine, where he painted scenes of the harbour framed by the towering mountain range. This village truly shines in winter, when you have the chance to see the northern lights twinkling in the night sky.","date":"Dec 17, 2024","bsTitle":"A shore to adore","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241216_ReinefjordenNorway%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"68e98e8f6b45cd2cabc9af71c5f04209","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ReinefjordenNorway_EN-IN1479907327_tmb.jpg","title":"Traditional red fishermen's cabins, Reine, Norway","desc":"Step aside, regular beach houses—Reine's little red cabins are here to steal the show.
