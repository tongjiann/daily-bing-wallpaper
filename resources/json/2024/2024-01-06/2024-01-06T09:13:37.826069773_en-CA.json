The city welcomes an icy twist to its fashion in January by opening its frosty doors to the Harbin International Ice and Snow Festival. This festival traces its origins to a humble garden party that featured ice lanterns in 1963 and has since evolved into an event where sculptors from around the world came together to create sculptures from the frozen waters of the Songhua River. This wonderland has towering castles, lanterns and intricate sculptures, all made of ice. In 2007, 'Romantic Feelings,' the world's largest snow sculpture at 35 metres in height, was created here in the shape of an Olympic-themed artwork. During the evenings, multicoloured lights illuminate the translucent sculptures, adding another layer of charm. While exploring Harbin, you can try alpine skiing and, if you're feeling brave, winter swimming in the Songhua River.","date":"Jan. 5, 2024","bsTitle":"Chisels and chills","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240105_HarbinFestival%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"40b1a14648bb1be5b34455dc7990ab55","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HarbinFestival_EN-CA4930649632_tmb.jpg","title":"International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival, Harbin, China","desc":"Harbin, in Heilongjiang, the northernmost province of China, has a fascinating blend of architecture influenced by Russian and European…","hash":"D85VX5JDddS1ap3PnaU/TmyWNj61pa0GDgZSMpItdJs="}},{"startdate":"20240104","fullstartdate":"202401040500","enddate":"20240105","url":"/th?id=OHR.GoldenGateLight_EN-CA5633568958_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.GoldenGateLight_EN-CA5633568958","copyright":"Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, California (© Jim Patterson/Tandem Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Golden+Gate+Bridge&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240104_0500%22","title":"A mist-ical marvel","caption":"Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, California","copyrightonly":"© Jim Patterson/Tandem Stills + Motion","desc":"An exemplary engineering accomplishment, the Golden Gate Bridge stands like a sentinel over the entrance to San Francisco Bay.

The bridge was painted International Orange—the golden adjective refers to the sun-reflecting waters below—and was opened to the public in 1937. It wasn't an easy vision to accomplish, especially as it was built during the Great Depression. The infrastructure investment paid off, as its construction employed thousands, contributing to both local employment and technological growth.
