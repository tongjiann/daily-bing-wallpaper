Well, you guessed it right, it's the Anna's hummingbird. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backwards. Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects. Fun fact: these birds can remember every flower they've visited and how long it will take a flower to refill with nectar.","date":"Sep. 7, 2024","bsTitle":"Humming along","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240907_SantaCruzHummer%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5f15bff8a7abff5f3ed63292e5348bd0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SantaCruzHummer_EN-CA9641643755_tmb.jpg","title":"Anna's hummingbird","desc":"Does the bird in today's image look familiar?
