With its shimmering emerald feathers and sparkling rose-pink throat, this little bird is a sight to behold. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backwards. Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects.","date":"7 Sep 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240907_SantaCruzHummer%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"61b7f2dc47b461885b39c345f5ab59df","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SantaCruzHummer_ROW3345595068_tmb.jpg","title":"Anna's hummingbird","desc":"Let's meet Anna's hummingbird, seen in today's image.
