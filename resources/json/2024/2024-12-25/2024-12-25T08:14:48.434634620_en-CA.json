Written by Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in 1892, this beloved ballet is based on E.T.A. Hoffmann's fairy tale 'The Nutcracker and the Mouse King.' Set on Christmas Eve, it follows a young girl named Clara, who goes on an adventure with the Nutcracker Prince as they battle the evil Mouse King. Many renowned ballet companies present their rendition of this classic every year, including the New York City Ballet, the Boston Ballet and the English National Ballet, pictured here.","date":"Dec. 18, 2024","bsTitle":"Yule really love this ballet","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241218_NutcrackerBallet%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"2c7273b78cb34a21ec7bd89c92fc879f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NutcrackerBallet_EN-CA9033194667_tmb.jpg","title":"English National Ballet performing 'The Nutcracker'","desc":"Every holiday season, as snow begins to fall and Christmas lights twinkle in the night, the story of 'The Nutcracker' comes to life on…","hash":"kq3lrLfaJSuDR1mO1jPOdiY9D6P/POmoO/++OwdI/zw="}},{"startdate":"20241217","fullstartdate":"202412170500","enddate":"20241218","url":"/th?id=OHR.ReinefjordenNorway_EN-CA2665608310_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ReinefjordenNorway_EN-CA2665608310","copyright":"Traditional red fishermen's cabins on the shore of Reinefjorden, Norway (© Pilat666/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Lofoten+Norway&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220241217_0500%22","title":"A shore to adore","caption":"Traditional red fishermen's cabins, Reine, Norway","copyrightonly":"© Pilat666/Getty Images","desc":"Step aside, regular beach houses—Reine's little red cabins are here to steal the show.

The village's waterfront is lined with the traditional fishermen's cabins called rorbu or rorbuer, which are mostly red in colour, as seen in today's image. Once important to fishermen, these cabins have now become a popular pick for tourist rentals. In 1999, German painter Ingo Kühl set up a pop-up studio in a rorbu in Reine, where he painted scenes of the harbour framed by the towering mountain range.

The area around the lake is known for its beneficial climate, especially for those with respiratory conditions. Its crystal-clear waters and surrounding hotels provide a perfect getaway for up to 500 visitors. The lake played a role in the 1956 Winter Olympics, where it hosted speed skating events on natural ice, and it has even been immortalised in a pop song by singer Claudio Baglioni.

Founded by ornithologist Frank Chapman as an eco-friendly twist on holiday hunting parties, this annual event replaced shotguns with binoculars. Since then, it has become one of the world's longest-running citizen science projects. Every year from December 14 to January 5, volunteers of all ages and birding skill levels come together to survey designated areas called 'circles.' Each circle has a diameter of approximately 24 kilometres, and participants count every bird they see or hear within it. The result is a colossal snapshot of bird diversity, with data collected from over 2,500 locations each season. It's a serious effort to track changes in bird populations, providing valuable data for scientists working to protect vulnerable species.","date":"Dec. 14, 2024","bsTitle":"'Hoo' said that?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241214_NorthernHawkOwl%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e4b17dc302173e9b282fce22e8fe7d0d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NorthernHawkOwl_EN-CA1011187644_tmb.jpg","title":"Christmas Bird Count turns 125","desc":"For 125 years, bird enthusiasts across North America have turned the holiday season into a festive, feathered affair with the Christmas Bird…","hash":"erwdb2da0MOGa6QSGuDtBGKR9SJzAZA7kzg8rMHqKvw="}},{"startdate":"20241213","fullstartdate":"202412130500","enddate":"20241214","url":"/th?id=OHR.ChristmasBudapest_EN-CA2975655898_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ChristmasBudapest_EN-CA2975655898","copyright":"Christmas market, St. Stephen's Basilica, Budapest, Hungary (© Calin Stan/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=St+Stephens+Basilica+Budapest&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220241213_0500%22","title":"Advent at the basilica","caption":"Christmas market, St. Stephen's Basilica, Budapest, Hungary","copyrightonly":"© Calin Stan/Shutterstock","desc":"As the holiday season kicks off, St. Stephen's Basilica becomes the dazzling centrepiece of one of Budapest's iconic Christmas markets.
