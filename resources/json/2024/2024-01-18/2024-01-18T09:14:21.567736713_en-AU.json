The Eurasian lynx, sporting a grey or rusty fur with patterned dark spots, is hard to catch sight of, even though it is widely distributed from Europe to Central Asia and Siberia. Known for their elusive nature, these cats often go unnoticed for years in their native habitats. Their low vocalisations are heard by other lynx but can escape the notice of humans. Eurasian lynxes are primarily active at night, dawn and dusk, but can hunt during the day when they need to. These solitary hunters are renowned for their keen senses and remarkable agility. In temperate forests, where they play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance by keeping prey species numbers in check, their primary food includes rabbits, hares, marmots and other small mammals.","date":"11 Jan 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240111_LynxSnow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"56b7d887e8b8874ff9ef6c10baad9c26","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LynxSnow_ROW2815737561_tmb.jpg","title":"Eurasian lynx","desc":"Ready for a next-level staring contest?

These rocks are composed of granite, and their peculiar shape is the result of millions of years of weathering and erosion. Did you know that the Earth's oldest rock is truly out of this world? Lunar sample 14321, or 'Big Bertha,' has been dated to be approximately 4.46 billion years old—just a smidge younger than the Earth itself—and was recovered from the moon during the Apollo 14 mission.
