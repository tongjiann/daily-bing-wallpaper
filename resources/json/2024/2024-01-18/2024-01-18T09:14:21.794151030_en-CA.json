The Eurasian lynx, sporting grey or rusty fur with patterned dark spots, is hard to catch sight of, even though it is widely distributed from Europe to Central Asia and Siberia. Known for their elusive nature, these cats often go unnoticed for years in their native habitats. Their low vocalisations are heard by other lynx but can escape the notice of humans. Eurasian lynx are primarily active at night, dawn and dusk, but can hunt during the day when they need to. These solitary hunters are renowned for their keen senses and remarkable agility. In temperate forests, where they play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance by keeping prey species numbers in check, their primary food includes rabbits, hares, marmots and other small mammals.","date":"Jan. 11, 2024","bsTitle":"A whiskered wanderer","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240111_LynxSnow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7358a8c831d20d5515ffdc59a087f7a2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LynxSnow_EN-CA9725800228_tmb.jpg","title":"Eurasian lynx","desc":"Ready for a next-level staring contest?

This wonderland has towering castles, lanterns and intricate sculptures, all made of ice. In 2007, 'Romantic Feelings,' the world's largest snow sculpture at 35 metres in height, was created here in the shape of an Olympic-themed artwork.
