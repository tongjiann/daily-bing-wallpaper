Befitting the nobility of the event, two 17-metre pylons sit upon each bank of the river, crowned with gilt-bronze sculptures of the winged horse Pegasus. And that's only at the start of the bridge!

They aren't alone in the park though—the forest teems with life, including lynxes, bears, pygmy owls and Eurasian wolves.

Although it holds regional variations, it is predominantly celebrated by flying kites, symbolic of the sun's transition. As part of the observance, communities come together to express gratitude for a bountiful harvest. Makar Sankranti is also marked by various fairs across India. Among them is the renowned Kumbha Mela, which occurs every 12 years in holy locations like Haridwar, Prayag, Ujjain and Nashik.
