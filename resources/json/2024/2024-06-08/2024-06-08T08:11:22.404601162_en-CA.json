Here, the air thrums with the calls of over 350 bird species like limpkins and snail kites, while the waters teem with life too: fish, like snook and redfish and American crocodiles are all found here. Beyond its biodiversity, the park has earned global recognition, celebrated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve and a Wetland of International Importance.

These flowers also play crucial roles in the valley's ecosystem. Lupines are nitrogen-fixing plants; they help improve soil fertility by converting atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be used by neighbouring plants. Balsamroot, on the other hand, attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies, which helps in plant reproduction and, in turn, contributes to the biodiversity of the region.
