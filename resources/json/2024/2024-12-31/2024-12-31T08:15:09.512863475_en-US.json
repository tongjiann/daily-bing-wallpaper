This is the unofficial motto of a non-commercial alternative to Christmas. Celebrated on December 23, Festivus was popularized by the TV show 'Seinfeld,' although it was actually invented by the family of one of the series' writers. The celebration centers around the unadorned aluminum Festivus pole. After dinner, the traditional Festivus 'airing of grievances' gets underway. This consists of telling friends and family the ways they've disappointed you over the year. This can provide some much-needed catharsis at what can be a stressful time of year. The day traditionally concludes with feats of strength. Once the head of the household has been pinned, Festivus is officially over. Those who embrace this farcical holiday welcome the opportunity to let off some steam amid the Christmas build-up chaos—much like these red-crowned cranes in Hokkaido, Japan.","date":"Dec 23, 2024","bsTitle":"Ready to let off some steam?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241223_FestivusCranes%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1efcce9d1507563c29927d394e0127b5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FestivusCranes_EN-US0396321898_tmb.jpg","title":"Celebrating Festivus","desc":"'A Festivus for the rest of us!'
