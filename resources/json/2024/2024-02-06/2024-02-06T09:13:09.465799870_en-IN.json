Bonsai traditionally contain a single tree or a small group of trees of the same species, so the description fits this site well. Part of the purpose of bonsai is to provide an opportunity for contemplation, so if you visit Bonsai Rock, find a place to relax and explore your thoughts.","date":"Feb 6, 2024","bsTitle":"Nature's bonsai","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240205_LakeTahoeRock%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9aca4a2b89e32dffa60a4b34e1af5f63","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LakeTahoeRock_EN-IN9092668370_tmb.jpg","title":"Lake Tahoe, Nevada","desc":"Peeking out of Lake Tahoe—the largest alpine lake in North America and the second-deepest lake in the United States— Bonsai Rock and its…","hash":"3ZdW7wfVr23/MaNkWymO/IEeJuFvCjk/Fnhr3WHaB+M="}},{"startdate":"20240204","fullstartdate":"202402041830","enddate":"20240205","url":"/th?id=OHR.WesternMonarchs_EN-IN8519228057_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.WesternMonarchs_EN-IN8519228057","copyright":"Monarch butterflies, Goleta, California (© Craig Rademacher/500px/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Monarch+butterflies&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240204_1830%22","title":"Butterfly ballet","caption":"Monarch butterflies","copyrightonly":"© Craig Rademacher/500px/Getty Images","desc":"Monarch butterflies, with their vibrant orange and black wings, are found across southern regions, from coastal meadows to urban gardens.
