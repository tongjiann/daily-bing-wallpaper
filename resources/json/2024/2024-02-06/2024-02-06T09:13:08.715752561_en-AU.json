The peculiar sight of four trees growing out of what appears to be a massive granite rock inspired a name that comes from the Japanese art of growing miniature trees. Bonsai traditionally contain a single tree or a small group of trees of the same species, so the description fits this site well. Part of the purpose of bonsai is to provide an opportunity for contemplation, so if you visit Bonsai Rock, find a place to relax and explore your thoughts.","date":"6 Feb 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240206_LakeTahoeRock%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4614b5820f8c518d120c5bb0e469fabd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LakeTahoeRock_ROW4668263342_tmb.jpg","title":"Lake Tahoe","desc":"Peeking out of Lake Tahoe—the largest Alpine lake in North America and the second-deepest lake in the United States— Bonsai Rock and its…","hash":"999wIhqYJICpPUmb6526vJzfZTmdnLuY9oN/ZnOdFH4="}},{"startdate":"20240205","fullstartdate":"202402050800","enddate":"20240206","url":"/th?id=OHR.WesternMonarchs_ROW4483453788_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.WesternMonarchs_ROW4483453788","copyright":"Monarch butterflies, Goleta, California (© Craig Rademacher/500px/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Monarch+butterflies&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240205_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Monarch butterflies","copyrightonly":"© Craig Rademacher/500px/Getty Images","desc":"Around this time of year, beautiful, flame-coloured monarch butterflies finish their long migration that starts hundreds of kilometres north in October of the previous year.

They engage in communication with one another through a range of auditory signals, including whistles, screams and teeth chattering.
