Every year, as Hudson Bay freezes over, polar bears congregate here, waiting to return to their icy hunting grounds. The largest land carnivores, equipped with an incredible sense of smell and powerful limbs, traverse the rocky landscapes. They primarily feed on various species of seals, walruses and beluga whale. Their thick fur is perfect for insulation, and their large paws are designed like snowshoes, making them capable of surviving in the harshest of climates. A lot of globetrotters are found here during this season, paying a visit to these marine mammals, as 64 to 80 per cent of polar bears worldwide are found in Canada.","date":"Feb. 1, 2024","bsTitle":"A long winter's nap","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240201_PolarBearResting%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7479182d266c40f0fb827b71a5bcfee7","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PolarBearResting_EN-CA5363891860_tmb.jpg","title":"Polar bear, Churchill, Manitoba","desc":"In the rugged terrain of Churchill, Manitoba, a polar bear finds solace on a bed of stone covered with ice and snow.

Today's snapshot shows Burchell's zebras, a subspecies of the plains zebra, in Rietvlei Nature Reserve, South Africa. Found across eastern and southern Africa, zebras thrive in savannas, shrublands, woodlands and even mountain regions. They spend most of their time eating—grasses, leaves and shrubs are their favourites—and have been known to travel hundreds of kilometres in search of food and water. Sadly, all three varieties of zebra are under threat from hunting and habitat destruction, so events like International Zebra Day that draw attention to their plight are more necessary than ever.","date":"Jan. 31, 2024","bsTitle":"Stripe a pose","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240131_ZebraMother%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"84d422279949471a6f68721f4a150c30","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ZebraMother_EN-CA5020659638_tmb.jpg","title":"International Zebra Day","desc":"It's time for some black-and-white thinking.
