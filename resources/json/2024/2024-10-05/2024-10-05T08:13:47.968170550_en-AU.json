Italian architect Baldassare Longhena envisioned this structure at the age of 26, and it became his lifelong project, which was completed after his death. The exterior of the church, with its volutes—spiral, scroll-like ornaments—and statues contrasts with the spacious octagonal interior adorned with works by Renaissance artists like Titian and Tintoretto. Each November, Venice commemorates the church's significance during the Festa della Madonna della Salute, a cultural celebration that includes festive processions and offering of candles in gratitude for deliverance from the plague.","date":"27 Sep 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240927_VeniceAerial%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a871aa06511db33e0ec96a86d436a75c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VeniceAerial_ROW7352144146_tmb.jpg","title":"Basilica of Santa Maria della Salute, Venice, Italy","desc":"Steeped in history, the Santa Maria della Salute church in Venice is a prime example of Baroque architecture.

Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. Weighing 14 to 45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 were left. Thankfully, an international hunting ban, conservation efforts, and reintroduction programs have helped them rebound, and they are now found in about two-thirds of their historic habitat. So, whenever you see their fuzzy heads bobbing in the waves, remember, you're witnessing a story of nature's triumph.","date":"23 Sep 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240923_IcebergOtter%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0119deab60868e4563167039a193b6ce","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.IcebergOtter_ROW6436603276_tmb.jpg","title":"Sea otter, Alaska, USA","desc":"The otter featured in today's image was photographed in Prince William Sound, Alaska, United States.
