Here, the air thrums with the calls of over 350 bird species like limpkins and snail kites, while the waters teem with life too: fish, like snook and redfish and American crocodiles are all found here. Beyond its biodiversity, the park has earned global recognition, celebrated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve and a Wetland of International Importance.
