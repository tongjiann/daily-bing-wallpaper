It was once the site of an extravagant house built in the 1930s by Madame Antoinette Sherri, a flamboyant 1920s costume designer known for her lavish parties. Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney.","date":"Oct. 23, 2024","bsTitle":"Stairway to nowhere","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241023_MadameSherriCastle%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a64446ec1715fbecff5a21c3682928fa","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MadameSherriCastle_EN-CA4239046959_tmb.jpg","title":"Madame Sherri Forest, New Hampshire, United States","desc":"Madame Sherri Forest in Chesterfield in New Hampshire, United States, is a captivating destination steeped in history and natural beauty.
