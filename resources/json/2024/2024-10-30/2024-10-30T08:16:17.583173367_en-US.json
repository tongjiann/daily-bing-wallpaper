It was once the site of an extravagant house built in the 1930s by Madame Antoinette Sherri, a flamboyant 1920s costume designer known for her lavish parties. Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalized. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase, and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney.","date":"Oct 23, 2024","bsTitle":"Stairway to nowhere","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241023_MadameSherriCastle%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e03f425984563ea51e6f7092e949ee56","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MadameSherriCastle_EN-US3066456106_tmb.jpg","title":"Madame Sherri Forest, New Hampshire","desc":"Madame Sherri Forest in Chesterfield, New Hampshire, is a captivating destination steeped in history and natural beauty.

Welcome to the Palazzo Zuccari, a 16th-century palace where myths seem to come to life on its façade—grotesque faces swallow up its doors and windows. Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters. His painting of the Last Judgment in Florence Cathedral and his illustrations of Dante's Inferno are replete with mythical beings. The monster door originally led to the palazzo's garden because Zuccari enjoyed making his guests experience the contrast between the scary entrance and the beautiful serenity of the garden. These days, the door leads to the Bibliotheca Hertziana, a library specializing in Italian art history, from the Middle Ages to the modern day, which has occupied the site of the garden since 1912.","date":"Oct 22, 2024","bsTitle":"Fearsome façade","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241022_MonsterDoor%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5bf089fcd6133cd087719dc0645f111a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MonsterDoor_EN-US2973387472_tmb.jpg","title":"Palazzo Zuccari, Rome","desc":"At the top of the Spanish Steps in Rome, take a left underneath the imposing Catholic church.

Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the southeastern US. Winding through the park are over 7 miles of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat. The hardwood trees here are a haven for woodpeckers and other birds, while the soft soil provides ideal burrowing ground for tortoises.
