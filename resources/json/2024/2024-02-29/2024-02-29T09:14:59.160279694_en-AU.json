With recent additions bringing their total to 96, these huts have become one of Melbourne's premier tourist attractions. The history of bathing boxes goes back to when they first popped up on Brighton's coastline in 1860, providing a modest cover for bathers swapping for their bathing suits. Worn out and damaged during the post-World War I depression, the beach huts received collective maintenance in 1934. Despite the upkeep, the multi-hued structures were faced with the threat of removal in 1952. But thanks to the Brighton Bathing Box Association for successfully securing their survival, we can still enjoy the vibrant coastguards today!","date":"22 Feb 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240222_BrightonBoxes%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8db54bf677bdb366bbf0ee8324b0d765","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BrightonBoxes_ROW8908835470_tmb.jpg","title":"Bathing boxes at Brighton Beach, Australia","desc":"The Brighton Bathing Boxes on Melbourne's Brighton Beach, painted with a rainbow of colours, are enduring relics.

For a couple of weeks in February, if skies are clear, water is flowing and the sun shines at just the right angle, the long, slender waterfall takes on a glowing, flame-hued appearance. Hundreds gather in Yosemite Valley to observe this mesmerising natural occurrence, to the point where finding a space to watch from can be a challenge.

In 1932, this area was the stage for a historic mass trespass, where hundreds of people on foot protested for public access to these lands. This act of civil disobedience contributed to the passing of legislation that established national parks in the United Kingdom.
