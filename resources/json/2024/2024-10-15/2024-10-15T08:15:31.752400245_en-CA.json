Today's image features Coco Beach, a gem tucked away in Nerul, a village in the northern part of the state. Despite its calm vibes, there's plenty to do here. You can soak up the sun and dive into adventures like fishing, boating, dolphin spotting and swimming, all while immersing yourself in the local culture. But there's something that makes this beach even more special: its historical significance. It played an important role in the Goa Liberation Movement during the 1950s and 60s. It was one of the places where locals fought to end Portuguese rule and unite Goa with India. So, Coco isn't just another beach; it's a place with stories to tell, where history meets the sea.","date":"Oct. 14, 2024","bsTitle":"Sandy secrets and sunsets","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241014_CocoBeach%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"be9cc00212a78fe4841ed48c713f971f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CocoBeach_EN-CA6585712044_tmb.jpg","title":"Fishing boats at Coco Beach in Goa, India","desc":"Welcome to every beach lover's dream: Goa.

Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous.
