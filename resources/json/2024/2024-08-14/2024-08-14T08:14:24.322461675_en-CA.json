These little climbers have specialised toe pads that let them scale walls and even walk on ceilings. Then there's the chameleon, known for its colour-changing skin. While many think it's all about blending in, chameleons also change colour to communicate and regulate their temperature.","date":"Aug. 14, 2024","bsTitle":"Feeling sharp today","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240814_WatarrkaLizard%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"bd2f1eab1925ba3f7cf9c9b10ce7cd67","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WatarrkaLizard_EN-CA4804344545_tmb.jpg","title":"World Lizard Day","desc":"From mythology to modern media, lizards have often been portrayed as scary reptiles.
