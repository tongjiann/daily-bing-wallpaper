These little climbers have specialised toe pads that let them scale walls and even walk on ceilings. Then there's the chameleon, known for its colour-changing skin. While many think it's all about blending in, chameleons also change colour to communicate and regulate their temperature.","date":"Aug 14, 2024","bsTitle":"Feeling sharp today","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240813_WatarrkaLizard%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c8f8be65f8e98989718ad997d9724f89","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WatarrkaLizard_EN-IN4528148622_tmb.jpg","title":"World Lizard Day","desc":"From mythology to modern media, lizards have often been portrayed as scary reptiles.

Its earliest known residents were people from the Pinto culture, who lived here from 8000 to 4000 BCE. Centuries later, this land was inhabited by the native Cahuilla, Serrano and Chemehuevi peoples. The park's namesake, the Joshua tree, grows in a landscape covering 3,216 square kilometres. Despite their name, they are not really trees but rather a kind of succulent. Native to the southwest US and northern Mexico, they can grow up to 12 metres tall. Whether it's hiking through Hidden Valley, visiting the Cholla Cactus Garden or marvelling at Skull Rock, this national park has a lot to offer.
