Recognised as an International Biosphere Reserve, this national park features over 890 kilometres of trails, where hikers can embark on a trek along the coast to see the beach's sea arch at Point of the Arches, an outcrop that has over 30 sea stacks, columns of rock rising from the beach.","date":"Nov. 6, 2024","bsTitle":"Shades of sunset","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241106_ShiShiBeach%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"81490b3071ceff6a0fb8b5e9d983bb68","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ShiShiBeach_EN-CA3486295094_tmb.jpg","title":"Shi Shi Beach, Olympic National Park, Washington, United States","desc":"Olympic National Park in Washington, United States, established in 1938, offers an escape into unspoiled wilderness.

Here, visitors are greeted by old cottages and homes built from local bluish-green slate. Dove Cottage, Wordsworth's humble abode from 1799 to 1808, and the adjacent museum offer a dive into the poet's life. His later residence, Rydal Mount, continues the story just a short journey away. The heart of the village is St. Oswald's Church, which dates to the 13th century. This landmark is Wordsworth's final resting place. Not far from the church, the aroma of the renowned Grasmere Gingerbread, made from a secret recipe, will set visitors' mouths watering. The village's annual Grasmere Sports, which began in 1868, is an event that showcases traditional Lakeland activities like fell running, wrestling and hound trailing.","date":"Nov. 4, 2024","bsTitle":"Worth a thousand words","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241104_CumbriaAutumn%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c27299f917668b552739719630a43e7a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CumbriaAutumn_EN-CA3180790128_tmb.jpg","title":"Grasmere, Lake District, Cumbria, England","desc":"A place where poetry, history and nature blend—welcome to Grasmere in England's Lake District.
