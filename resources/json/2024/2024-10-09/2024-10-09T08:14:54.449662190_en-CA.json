This range was named after William Ogilvie, who was a Canadian Dominion land surveyor. Part of the Yukon Ranges, these mountains are crossed by the Dempster Highway, a route famed for its pristine views. Some of the picturesque peaks of Ogilvie Mountains are located within Tombstone Territorial Park.
