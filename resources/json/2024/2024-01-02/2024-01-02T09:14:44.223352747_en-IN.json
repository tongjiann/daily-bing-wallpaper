Also known as Sanchi Stupa, the monument was commissioned by Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BCE and is the oldest stone structure in India. Sanchi's massive hemispherical dome, crowned by an elegant harmika and a central pillar, beckons visitors into a sacred realm. The intricately carved gateways, or toranas, tell stories of Buddha's life, enlightenment and the flourishing of Buddhism under Ashoka's patronage.

These social birds are known for their lively and energetic behaviour, both on land and in the water. Agile swimmers, chinstrap penguins use their powerful flippers to navigate the frigid waters in search of their primary diet—small fish, krill, and other marine creatures.
