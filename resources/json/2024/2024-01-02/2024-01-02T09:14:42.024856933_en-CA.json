December 26 marks Boxing Day—an opportunity to keep the festive spirit going or to enjoy a wintry walk through the local markets while sipping hot chocolate. The origin of the day is thought to come from the old British tradition of giving 'boxes' filled with presents to people in need on the day after Christmas; modern Boxing Day is celebrated here in Canada and several other Commonwealth countries. Although this holiday is still associated with giving gifts, it also has other customs. Various events are held across Canada: ice hockey fans gather to cheer on their favourite teams and people gather to enjoy a festive meal and spend time with their families.

To the south of the city lies the Ljubljana Marsh, the largest marsh in the country, covering 163 square kilometres. While modern buildings have cropped up on the city's periphery, the core of the town preserves its historic structures, which have ancient Roman and mediaeval elements.
