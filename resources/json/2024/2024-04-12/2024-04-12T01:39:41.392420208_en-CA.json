Lechwe are social animals, often found in herds of thousands. In the heart of the delta, they are an integral part of the region's rich biodiversity, coexisting with other species like elephants, lions, rhinos and hippos, wading through the water. Their presence adds to the delta's natural allure, which draws in thousands of safari enthusiasts and is proof of wildlife's resilience in the face of environmental challenges.","date":"Apr. 4, 2024","bsTitle":"Wanderers of the wetlands","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240404_AntelopeBotswana%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"512e6d693f85f6bdd11cc282cf2b17bd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AntelopeBotswana_EN-CA1764175316_tmb.jpg","title":"Red lechwe, Okavango Delta, Botswana","desc":"With their elegant leaps and graceful movements, lechwe are the epitome of agility and poise on the African savanna.

This symbiotic relationship provides them with a greenish hue, offering effective camouflage within the rainforest canopy.
