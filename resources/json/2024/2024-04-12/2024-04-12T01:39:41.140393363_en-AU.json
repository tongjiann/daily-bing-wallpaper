Also known as Dragon Falls, the cascade featured in today's image is in a narrow niche at the southern end of the canyon that divides the mountain of Auyan Tepui. Falling from around 979 metres, Churún Merú is joined by a neighbouring stream in the wet season. Venezuela is home to some of the world's most impressive natural wonders, including the highest waterfall on Earth, Angel Falls, found some 6 kilometres south of Churún Marú. James Angel, who is often wrongly credited with finding Angel Falls, may have discovered the Dragon waterfall. Something that supports this theory is the fact that Angel Falls is often misidentified as the Dragon Falls. So, whether you're after Angels or Dragons, Venezuela has a waterfall for you!","date":"11 Apr 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240411_DragonWaterfall%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c7dbaae74c85fb12e38b9ba9d5c8126a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DragonWaterfall_ROW2079531837_tmb.jpg","title":"Dragon waterfall, Venezuela","desc":"In the heart of the wilderness, an awe-inspiring sight plummets from a mountain—the Churún Merú waterfall in Venezuela!

Their name comes from their ability to inhabit burrows dug by mammals like prairie dogs, skunks or armadillos, where they nest and roost. They often look out for each other, warning one another of predators. They lay three to five eggs per clutch, incubating them for about a month. The lifespan of these cute creatures is about six to eight years.","date":"10 Apr 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240410_OwlSiblings%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d3d5f0b05eaf19c028e766bcd6364a5c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OwlSiblings_ROW6315129665_tmb.jpg","title":"Burrowing owl chicks, Wyoming, USA","desc":"In today's image, we see four burrowing owls in Wyoming, USA, standing near their burrow, looking like a band of mischievous siblings.
