Featured here is a group of gemsboks, a large antelope, reigning over the sprawling savannahs in southwestern Africa. Indigenous to the arid territories of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and parts of Zimbabwe, they thrive mainly within the Kalahari and Namib Deserts. They can survive in extremely dry conditions and can go without water for weeks, getting moisture from the food they eat. Moreover, gemsboks are adept runners, achieving speeds of up to 59 kilometres per hour. Their distinguishing trait is their notably elongated, straight horns. Although both genders possess these formidable defences, the females' horns tend to be slightly longer and sleeker while the males' horns are thicker with broader bases. So, if you ever find yourself in the sandy plains of the Kalahari, keep an eye out for these desert gems.","date":"Jun 11, 2024","bsTitle":"These antelopes are real gems","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240610_GemsbokBotswana%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"64faada0a7ad8e66a12108d820cee763","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GemsbokBotswana_EN-IN8918609883_tmb.jpg","title":"A group of Southern gemsbok in the savannah, Botswana","desc":"Horns up, heads high!

The Killik River originates in the northern area of the Gates of the Arctic National Park and flows approximately 217 kilometres north until it meets the Colville River at Killik Bend. This is a region of the high arctic with few trees and lots of tundra and muskeg. The lower stretch of the river meanders slowly through lakes and permafrost terrain, while the upper portion remains nestled deep within the mountains. Numerous archaeological sites and traces of early Native American settlements and hunting activities are found throughout the region. The Rafters have access to two sections of the river, spanning 168 and 144 kilometres respectively, offering a rewarding 7 to 10-day journey.
