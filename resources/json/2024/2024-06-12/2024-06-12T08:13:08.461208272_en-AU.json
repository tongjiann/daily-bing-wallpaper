They catch their prey mid-flight, returning to a perch where they can beat stinging insects to stun them, which makes them safe to eat. These birds are designed to hunt: their dazzling green plumage helps camouflage them in dappled jungle light, their curved beak is perfect for picking off insects with precision and their eyes can move individually, which makes them all the better for spotting bees.","date":"4 Jun 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240604_ChestnutBeeEater%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a385ec86dc73249caca4efa57b5d78aa","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ChestnutBeeEater_ROW7342338865_tmb.jpg","title":"Chestnut-headed bee-eaters","desc":"It's not just a name.

Karl von Drais, a German inventor, is credited with developing the first two-wheeler, the 'swiftwalker,' in 1817. The machine certainly needed some further thinking, since the wooden frame and wheels didn't have pedals. Pedals attached to the front wheel were first introduced in the early 1860s in Paris, and the name velocipede was soon replaced by bicycle. The modern versions of bikes were developed in the late 1800s, but the materials used for them are still constantly evolving to make the ride easier and more secure.
