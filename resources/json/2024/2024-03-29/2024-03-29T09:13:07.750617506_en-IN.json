Water is a force that quenches thirst and irrigates harvests, and in its absence, it can derail prosperity and stability. The World Economic Forum lists the water crisis among the top global risks, and with 2.2 billion people still lacking access to clean water, this United Nations observance is a call to action to address the crisis. From educational forums to local cleanups, each action, big or small, contributes to the wave of change. This year's theme, 'Water for Peace,' invites us to reflect on the universal solvent's power to foster unity. So, are you ready to dive into a current that flows deeper than New Zealand's Blue Spring at Te Waihou Walkway? With about 70% of the country's bottled water coming from here, this spring mirrors the clarity and serenity we yearn for in the world.","date":"Mar 22, 2024","bsTitle":"'Water' we celebrating?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240321_WaikatoWater%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5e0753186bc0704de5349c56c983b0af","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WaikatoWater_EN-IN0496434558_tmb.jpg","title":"World Water Day","desc":"It's World Water Day, a 31-year-old annual tradition that ripples across the globe, reminding us of the importance of this essential…","hash":"byWZBpQaI6X5pDC2PO4drg1RejY1eRyS3j4u9g4fbrw="}},{"startdate":"20240320","fullstartdate":"202403201830","enddate":"20240321","url":"/th?id=OHR.BwindiNationalForest_EN-IN2480914473_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.BwindiNationalForest_EN-IN2480914473","copyright":"Bwindi Impenetrable National Forest, Uganda (© Art Wolfe/DanitaDelimont.com)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=International+Day+of+Forests&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240320_1830%22","title":"Woodn't it be nice","caption":"International Day of Forests","copyrightonly":"© Art Wolfe/DanitaDelimont.com","desc":"Today we're branching out and rooting for woodlands to celebrate the International Day of Forests!

Despite their diverse origins within Neobatrachia, these tree-dwelling frogs share the common adaptation of inhabiting arboreal environments. They tend to be small and slender since their weight has to be supported by branches and twigs in their habitats. They can be recognised by the sticky discs on the tips of their fingers and toes, which help them cling to surfaces.

In captivity, their diet may include other items such as honey, yams, eggs, fish, shrub leaves, bananas or oranges with food tailored to their nutritional needs. Pandas were initially believed to adhere to a crepuscular pattern of activity, being active at dawn and dusk.
