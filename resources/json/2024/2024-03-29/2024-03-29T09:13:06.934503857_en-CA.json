Water is a force that quenches thirst and irrigates harvests, and in its absence, it can derail prosperity and stability. The World Economic Forum lists the water crisis among the top global risks, and with 2.2 billion people still lacking access to clean water, this United Nations observance is a call to action to address the crisis. From educational forums to local cleanups, each action, big or small, contributes to the wave of change. This year's theme, 'Water for Peace,' invites us to reflect on the universal solvent's power to foster unity. So, are you ready to dive into a current that flows deeper than New Zealand's Blue Spring at Te Waihou Walkway? With about 70% of the country's bottled water coming from here, this spring mirrors the clarity and serenity we yearn for in the world.","date":"Mar. 22, 2024","bsTitle":"'Water' we celebrating?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240322_WaikatoWater%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"132ec29091fd90457d853cde117854d5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WaikatoWater_EN-CA3565028886_tmb.jpg","title":"World Water Day","desc":"It's World Water Day, a 31-year-old annual tradition that ripples across the globe, reminding us of the importance of this essential…","hash":"byWZBpQaI6X5pDC2PO4drg1RejY1eRyS3j4u9g4fbrw="}},{"startdate":"20240321","fullstartdate":"202403210400","enddate":"20240322","url":"/th?id=OHR.BwindiNationalForest_EN-CA3766951907_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.BwindiNationalForest_EN-CA3766951907","copyright":"Bwindi Impenetrable National Forest, Uganda (© Art Wolfe/DanitaDelimont.com)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=International+Day+of+Forests&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240321_0400%22","title":"Woodn't it be nice","caption":"International Day of Forests","copyrightonly":"© Art Wolfe/DanitaDelimont.com","desc":"Today we're branching out and rooting for woodlands to celebrate the International Day of Forests!

Forests play a crucial role in supplying essential resources like food, water and medicines.
