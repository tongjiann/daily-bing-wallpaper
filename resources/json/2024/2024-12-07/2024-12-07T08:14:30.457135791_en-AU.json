It is the coldest, driest and windiest of the Earth's continents, with temperatures plunging as low as -80 degrees Celsius. Vast ice sheets and glaciers found here hold about 70% of the world's fresh water. The waters are dotted with icebergs, as seen in today's image, which drift across the Southern Ocean and gradually melt over time.

The Campbells of Glenorchy, a powerful clan, made Kilchurn their base for generations, adding to the original structure over time. From its strategic location, the castle controlled access to the Highlands, making it an essential stronghold in Scottish conflicts. In the 17th century, Kilchurn took a more defensive role, being converted into a barracks during the Jacobite uprisings. But as fate would have it, Kilchurn wasn't destined to stay battle-ready forever. By the 1700s, it was abandoned and began its slow crumble into the ruin you see today. Even though it's no longer a fortress for soldiers, its craggy remains still inspire awe and admiration.","date":"30 Nov 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241130_KilchurnAutumn%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1cf1144cd0bafd07433b0b54b3817c93","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KilchurnAutumn_ROW4010675515_tmb.jpg","title":"Kilchurn Castle, Scotland","desc":"Today, we're visiting Kilchurn Castle, one of Scotland's historic landmarks, in the west of the country.
