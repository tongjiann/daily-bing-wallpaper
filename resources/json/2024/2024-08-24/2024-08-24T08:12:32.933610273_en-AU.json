Covering nearly 350 square kilometres, this monument was established in 2016. The region played a significant role in Maine's logging industry for more than 100 years, but towards the end of the 19th century, this activity began to decline. Efforts to preserve the landscape we see here today were spearheaded by philanthropist Roxanne Quimby. She and her foundation started purchasing land near Baxter State Park in 2001 and donated it to the federal government in 2016, ensuring its preservation for future generations.","date":"24 Aug 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240824_KatahdinWoods%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"de8e87087e4a1f722da545151cc5b67c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KatahdinWoods_ROW4600559064_tmb.jpg","title":"Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument, USA","desc":"Welcome to Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine, United States, where dense woodlands and pristine waterways stretch out as…","hash":"9a17FGSygvs2d9SZdrJ3bqs8EM/gpGcYS2JQBV6ZXjQ="}},{"startdate":"20240823","fullstartdate":"202408230700","enddate":"20240824","url":"/th?id=OHR.PrasatPhanom_ROW3985058133_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.PrasatPhanom_ROW3985058133","copyright":"Prasat Phanom Rung temple ruins, Buriram province, Thailand (© Banjongseal324/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Phanom+Rung+Historical+Park&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240823_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Prasat Phanom Rung temple ruins, Thailand","copyrightonly":"© Banjongseal324/Getty Images","desc":"Today, let us step into the Phanom Rung Historical Park in Buriram province, Thailand.
