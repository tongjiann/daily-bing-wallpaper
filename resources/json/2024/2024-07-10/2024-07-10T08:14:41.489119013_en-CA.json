Gracing the forests from Mexico through Costa Rica, where today’s image was taken, to Colombia and Venezuela, this member of the toucan family gets its name from the red collar on the back of the neck. Measuring 38 to 41 centimetres long and tipping the scales at a mere 175 to 250 grams, this bird is a wonder of nature's design. Both male and female aracaris share the same dazzling appearance. These birds circle through the air in groups of 6 to 15, and at night, they snuggle together in tree cavities. Their song is as unique as their look—a sharp 'seek' or a whimsical 'pink,' sometimes a purring sound or even a raspy 'grhhrr.' Although deforestation and hunting pose threats to these birds, they are currently classified as a least-concern species. For now, collared aracaris remains a captivating sight, a splash of colour and a burst of life amidst the sprawling branches.","date":"Jul. 10, 2024","bsTitle":"A 'toucan' of appreciation","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240710_CollaredAracari%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"cad4365b5f486adf7360b9479a061823","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CollaredAracari_EN-CA3486856563_tmb.jpg","title":"Collared aracari","desc":"Black and yellow plumage, bright eyes and an oversized bill—meet the collared aracari, a fascinating tropical bird.

These groups are a cooperative effort, with meerkats foraging together, grooming each other, babysitting and taking turns as sentinels to watch for predators.
