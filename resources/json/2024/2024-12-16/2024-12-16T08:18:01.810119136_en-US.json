The area around the lake is known for its beneficial climate, especially for those with respiratory conditions. Its crystal-clear waters and surrounding hotels provide a perfect getaway for up to 500 visitors. The lake played a role in the 1956 Winter Olympics, where it hosted speed skating events on natural ice, and it has even been immortalized in a pop song by singer Claudio Baglioni.

Founded by ornithologist Frank Chapman as an eco-friendly twist on holiday hunting parties, this annual event replaced shotguns with binoculars. Since then, it has become one of the world's longest-running citizen science projects. Every year from December 14 to January 5, volunteers of all ages and birding skill levels come together to survey designated areas called 'circles.' Each circle has a 15-mile diameter, and participants count every bird they see or hear within it. The result is a colossal snapshot of bird diversity, with data collected from over 2,500 locations each season. It's a serious effort to track changes in bird populations, providing valuable data for scientists working to protect vulnerable species.","date":"Dec 14, 2024","bsTitle":"'Hoo' said that?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241214_NorthernHawkOwl%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"053192a2c8e28dd5596ab10950745f69","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NorthernHawkOwl_EN-US7592435350_tmb.jpg","title":"Christmas Bird Count turns 125","desc":"For 125 years, bird enthusiasts across North America have turned the holiday season into a festive, feathered affair with the Christmas Bird…","hash":"erwdb2da0MOGa6QSGuDtBGKR9SJzAZA7kzg8rMHqKvw="}},{"startdate":"20241213","fullstartdate":"202412130800","enddate":"20241214","url":"/th?id=OHR.ChristmasBudapest_EN-US0865695821_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ChristmasBudapest_EN-US0865695821","copyright":"Christmas market, St. Stephen's Basilica, Budapest, Hungary (© Calin Stan/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=St+Stephen%27s+Basilica+Budapest&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220241213_0800%22","title":"Advent at the basilica","caption":"Christmas market, St. Stephen's Basilica, Budapest, Hungary","copyrightonly":"© Calin Stan/Shutterstock","desc":"As the holiday season kicks off, St. Stephen's Basilica becomes the dazzling centerpiece of one of Budapest's iconic Christmas markets.
