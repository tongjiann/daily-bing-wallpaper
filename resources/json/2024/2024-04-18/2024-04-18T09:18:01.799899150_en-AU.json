Within the picturesque confines of these Romanesque fortifications lies its cherished Old Town. It's a place where cobbled streets wind their way past ancient structures, each whispering tales of bygone eras. In 1985, Ávila was included in UNESCO's World Heritage List. The iconic walls that encircle the town were built by the Spanish to protect their territories from the Moors. Built between the 11th and 14th centuries, these fortifications have a perimeter of 2,516 metres, including 88 towers. When they were first built, they served to defend the city against attacks from outsiders; nowadays, visitors can walk around nearly half of the circumference of the walls, enjoying views of the city and the surrounding countryside.","date":"18 Apr 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240418_AvilaSpain%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6de2711c961cec7b46a3d158dc57910a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AvilaSpain_ROW3856149642_tmb.jpg","title":"Medieval city walls, Ávila, Spain","desc":"The stone structure in today's image is part of the medieval city walls of Ávila in Spain.

The weight of black bears—ranging between 45 kilograms and 270 kilograms in the case of adults—however, not only depends on their age, sex and the season but is also based on the diet available in their habitation.

The chateau's construction began in 1519. The castle showcases a centralised layout and a double helix staircase, which were inspired by da Vinci. The keep, the true heart of the building, reveals striking architecture, mixing medieval grandeur with Renaissance innovations. The building work was completed in the 17th century, under the reign of Louis XIV. Today, we can stroll through the English gardens, which offer adaptable pathways and a variety of plant selections, including conifers. With over 80 different species planted, the garden is designed to enrich the landscape and harmonise with the existing plantations.","date":"15 Apr 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240415_ChambordCastle%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ecae0bbde373b277813f58281df38b57","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ChambordCastle_ROW6581384117_tmb.jpg","title":"Château de Chambord, France","desc":"Let's admire the Château de Chambord, a pearl of the French Renaissance on the eastern part of the Loire River.

Bowling Ball Beach on the Mendocino Coast in California, USA, is named after the striking rock formations strewn across the shore. These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils. The answer, however, is quite simple: it is the forces of nature at play.","date":"14 Apr 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240414_BowlingBallCali%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3bfde20f4c2d09b34febac52f00fdf85","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BowlingBallCali_ROW9309619524_tmb.jpg","title":"Bowling Ball Beach, California, USA","desc":"Welcome to nature's bowling alley.
