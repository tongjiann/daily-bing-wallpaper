One of the oldest known religious locations, the Devils Marbles, holds significant value for Aboriginal Australians as an ancient sacred site. Today, the Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve—also called Karlu Karlu—in the Northern Territory of Australia preserves the collection of giant, round, gravity-defying boulders. These rocks are composed of granite, and their peculiar shape is the result of millions of years of weathering and erosion. Did you know that the Earth's oldest rock is truly out of this world? Lunar sample 14321, or 'Big Bertha,' has been dated to be approximately 4.46 billion years old—just a smidge younger than the Earth itself—and was recovered from the moon during the Apollo 14 mission. Scientists believe that the rock was a meteorite from Earth that hit the moon, and then we brought it all the way back, millions of years later. Whether you're a geology nerd or just a casual nature lover, embrace the minerals around you and rock on!","date":"7 Jan 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240107_DevilsMarbles%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3bd4b72fbf864e31c34b68d8bd6c8b94","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DevilsMarbles_ROW1186690103_tmb.jpg","title":"Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve, Australia","desc":"These aren't your ordinary rocks!

Gardeners and landscapers often appreciate their versatility and use them to enhance the visual appeal of outdoor environments. Whether as stand-alone specimens or part of larger garden designs, these bring a delightful blend of natural beauty and ecological benefits to diverse settings.","date":"6 Jan 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240106_CrabappleChaffinch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e6d3aa67ab24766507e0df31cd8b151a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CrabappleChaffinch_ROW0592693286_tmb.jpg","title":"A male chaffinch in a crab apple tree","desc":"Crab apple trees are known for their beauty and occasional harvests of small, vibrant fruits.

This bridge was the result of combined efforts put in by engineer Joseph Strauss, architect Irving Marrow and many others towards connecting San Francisco to Marin County. The bridge was painted International Orange—the golden adjective refers to the sun-reflecting waters below—and was opened to the public in 1937. It wasn't an easy vision to accomplish, especially as it was built during the Great Depression. The infrastructure investment paid off, as its construction employed thousands, contributing to both local employment and technological growth.

As the lake was dammed twice, first in 1895 and then in 1912 to reserve water for a hydroelectric plant downstream, the Minnewanka Landing settlement was submerged by the rising water levels.
