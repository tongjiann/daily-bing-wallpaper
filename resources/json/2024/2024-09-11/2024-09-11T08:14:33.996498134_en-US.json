These primarily nocturnal raptors were snapped in Pakistan and can be found in the forests and scrublands across South and Southeast Asia. An impressive wingspan of 15–17 inches, piercing yellow eyes, and exceptional hearing help them to catch small mammals and birds with precision in dim light. Measuring up to 2 feet tall, these feathered predators can also be spotted hunting in the daytime when the weather is cloudy. They often live in the abandoned nests of other birds or in natural crevices. Dusky eagle-owls breed in December and January, usually rearing their young in the safety of tall trees or cliff ledges. Nature lovers and bird watchers are captivated by their solemn gaze and elegant stature.","date":"Sep 4, 2024","bsTitle":"Birds of a feather hoot together","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240904_DuskyOwls%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1c103ab0f6d843cfebd2cf04ba139421","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DuskyOwls_EN-US9845705930_tmb.jpg","title":"Dusky eagle-owls, Pakistan","desc":"As daylight fades, dusky eagle-owls, the silent hunters seen in today's image, emerge from their nests.
