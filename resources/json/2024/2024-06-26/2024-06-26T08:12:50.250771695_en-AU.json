The plant flourishes in sandy and salty soils and propagates rapidly, painting the countryside with hues of purple, pink and blue. Although some consider lupine to be an invasive species that threatens native plants, its arrival is welcomed by locals and tourists as a cherished characteristic of the summer landscape. You can find lupine fields in various regions, including Reykjavík and near the Skógafoss waterfall. These flowers also line the road leading to the Hellissandur Church in the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, as seen in today's image.","date":"18 Jun 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240618_LupinIceland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"be3c8c9edcdc9b50dd1dc2c120458364","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LupinIceland_ROW2520380870_tmb.jpg","title":"Lupine fields, Snæfellsnes, Iceland","desc":"As spring gives way to summer in Iceland, the rugged landscape puts on a colourful parade.

Male red foxes are often referred to as tods or dogs, while their female counterparts are known as vixens. The younger generation is affectionately called cubs or kits. Female red foxes need to stay in their dens with their young after giving birth, so males spend their time going out to bring their food. When the pups are a little older, their father takes time to play with them, teaching them survival skills they'll need in later life, like hunting and scavenging.

It is on the Atlantic coast and is known for its giant waves, which can reach over 30 metres in height. Come winter, the surfers take over. Thanks to an underwater canyon, enormous waves form off the coast, making it a surfers' paradise. Several surf records have been broken here, including the biggest wave ever surfed—an incredible 26 metres. Surfing has a long history; around 5,000 years ago in Peru, people used reed watercraft to surf the waves when they were out fishing. It was in pre-colonial Hawaii, however, that modern surfing was born. Here, people started to stand on their boards and to surf for fun. So, wax down your surfboards and go out and catch some waves!","date":"15 Jun 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240615_NazareWave%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"bee81fe138bd4922812535c362a4773a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NazareWave_ROW1847563109_tmb.jpg","title":"Surfer in Nazaré, Portugal","desc":"Today's image shows an intrepid surfer riding a wave at Nazaré, Portugal.
