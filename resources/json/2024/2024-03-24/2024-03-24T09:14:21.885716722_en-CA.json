This observance, which was first held in 1961, commemorates the establishment of the World Meteorological Organisation in 1950. But this day is more than just a nod to history; it is all about recognising the vital role meteorology plays in our lives. Weather forecasts may not always appear fully reliable, but thanks to advances in technology like satellites and supercomputers, they have come a long way. Because of these advancements, global weather models provide forecasts for up to 16 days and, the average lead time for tornado warnings has gone from -15 minutes in 1974 to around 15 minutes today.

From educational forums to local cleanups, each action, big or small, contributes to the wave of change. This year's theme, 'Water for Peace,' invites us to reflect on the universal solvent's power to foster unity.
