Weather forecasts may not always appear fully reliable, but thanks to advances in technology like satellites and supercomputers, they have come a long way. Because of these advancements, global weather models provide forecasts for up to 16 days and, the average lead time for tornado warnings has gone from -15 minutes in 1974 to around 15 minutes today.
