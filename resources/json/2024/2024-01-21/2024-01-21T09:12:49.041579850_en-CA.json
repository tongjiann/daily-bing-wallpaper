These all-white birds with yellow-and-black bills, gliding on the mirror of Lake Kussharo in Japan, are whooper swans—the Eurasian equivalent to the North American trumpeter swans. Named for their loud 'whooping' call, these beauties, with a wingspan between 2 to 3 metres, are one of the world's heaviest birds that are able to fly. While whooper swans are Finland's national bird, they only spend their breeding season there. Those swans, as well as others in various northern areas, migrate to warmer, often coastal areas when cold weather sets in. All that travel doesn't ruin their relationships—these waterfowl form strong, monogamous pairs that can last for life.","date":"Jan. 14, 2024","bsTitle":"A feathered symphony in white","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240114_HokkaidoSwans%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"11df025d98d72c6d6ea0a920757705e9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HokkaidoSwans_EN-CA6678796195_tmb.jpg","title":"Whooper swans","desc":"An elegant creature for a majestic setting.

The Eurasian lynx, sporting grey or rusty fur with patterned dark spots, is hard to catch sight of, even though it is widely distributed from Europe to Central Asia and Siberia.

Eurasian lynx are primarily active at night, dawn and dusk, but can hunt during the day when they need to. These solitary hunters are renowned for their keen senses and remarkable agility. In temperate forests, where they play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance by keeping prey species numbers in check, their primary food includes rabbits, hares, marmots and other small mammals.","date":"Jan. 11, 2024","bsTitle":"A whiskered wanderer","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240111_LynxSnow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7358a8c831d20d5515ffdc59a087f7a2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LynxSnow_EN-CA9725800228_tmb.jpg","title":"Eurasian lynx","desc":"Ready for a next-level staring contest?
