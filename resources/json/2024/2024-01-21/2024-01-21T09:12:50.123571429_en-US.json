These squirrels are not only exceptional jumpers—capable of leaping up to 6 feet in one jump—they can even swim to search for food. They gather nuts and acorns in the autumn and hide them, to see them through the winter months. If you spot fuzzy-tailed squirrels frolicking in your backyard, they might also appreciate a feeding station stocked with treats such as raspberries or crab apples.","date":"Jan 21, 2024","bsTitle":"Tales from the treetops","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240121_SquirrelNetherlands%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"026d2dcdb3631f0f0c76a0e7325f6b68","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SquirrelNetherlands_EN-US2174319616_tmb.jpg","title":"Squirrel Appreciation Day","desc":"Have you ever been captivated by a squirrel crossing your path?
