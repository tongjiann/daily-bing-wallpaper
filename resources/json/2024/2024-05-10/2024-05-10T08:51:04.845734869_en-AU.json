Here, the waves gently caress the powder-white sands, while a kaleidoscope of marine life swims beneath the surface. The coral reefs, known for their biodiversity, are the dreams of many divers. Visitors can also explore the Pulau Misool Nature Reserve, established in 1982, and spot white cuscus, sugar gliders, common spiny bandicoots and other marsupials. As a 'no-take zone' with fishing and hunting activities banned and a shark and manta ray sanctuary, Misool offers hope for the future of our oceans.

Another drought-loving desert flora is the saguaro cactus, which can live for over 150 years and grow up to 12 metres tall. These cacti offer food and shelter to desert species.
