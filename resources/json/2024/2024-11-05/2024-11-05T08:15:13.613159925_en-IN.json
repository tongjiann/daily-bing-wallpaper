This architectural marvel was commissioned by Darna Shah, a local Jain businessman, in the 15th century after he experienced a divine vision. The temple is crafted in the form of the Nalini-Gulma Vimana—a heavenly vehicle that he envisioned in his dreams.

Here, visitors are greeted by old cottages and homes built from local bluish-green slate. Dove Cottage, Wordsworth's humble abode from 1799 to 1808, and the adjacent museum offer a dive into the poet's life. His later residence, Rydal Mount, continues the story just a short journey away. The heart of the village is St. Oswald's Church, which dates to the 13th century. This landmark is Wordsworth's final resting place. Not far from the church, the aroma of the renowned Grasmere Gingerbread, made from a secret recipe, will set visitors' mouths watering. The village's annual Grasmere Sports, which began in 1868, is an event that showcases traditional Lakeland activities like fell running, wrestling and hound trailing.","date":"Nov 4, 2024","bsTitle":"Worth a thousand words","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241103_CumbriaAutumn%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"aa669289f39865936569924f192b318f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CumbriaAutumn_EN-IN5406739257_tmb.jpg","title":"Grasmere, Lake District, Cumbria, England","desc":"A place where poetry, history and nature blend—welcome to Grasmere in England's Lake District.

Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States, featured in today's image. From the buffalo nickel to state flags, they are a deeply embedded symbol in American culture. Bison are North America's largest mammals, and they have been introduced as far away as Russia.
