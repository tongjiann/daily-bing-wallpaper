During the festivities, mooncakes—round delicacies filled with sweet bean paste, salted egg yolks or lotus seeds—are often shared among friends and family.

Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease.","date":"Sep 16, 2024","bsTitle":"Hoppily ever after","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240915_SunriseWallabies%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"cfd36084202fdf07de93f274f51b57f6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SunriseWallabies_EN-IN8975505298_tmb.jpg","title":"Wallabies at sunrise, Australia","desc":"Amid the hues of dawn, captured in today's image, two wallabies stand alert in a field near the Adelaide River in Australia.

Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backward.
