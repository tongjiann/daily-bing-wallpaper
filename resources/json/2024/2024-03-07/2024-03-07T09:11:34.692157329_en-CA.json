Overlooking the Ebro delta, the peak offers views of streams and pine forests, with trails that lead into the mountains. The word Benet comes from Arabic, hinting at the varied past that the area has had, including both Arabic and Christian settlers. These days, the park is home to a variety of fauna, from ibex and otters to vultures and eagles. Animals aren't the only inhabitants of the area. The villages nestled at the base of this massif have a sense of community and still maintain their shared traditions, such as the age-old craft of using vegetable fibres to create baskets and kitchen utensils.","date":"Mar. 7, 2024","bsTitle":"Reaching new heights","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240307_TarragonaSpain%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e5fa8f136146adcce8f49b8f6571ea7b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TarragonaSpain_EN-CA0184990294_tmb.jpg","title":"Roques de Benet, Els Ports Natural Park, Catalonia, Spain","desc":"Jutting into the sky above Els Ports Natural Park, the Roques de Benet is a cluster of rock formations in the Ports de Tortosa Beseit region…","hash":"XqUcetiqs18LDR04CxO7pf//9KkASeX+Cmf9Wu88g2A="}},{"startdate":"20240306","fullstartdate":"202403060500","enddate":"20240307","url":"/th?id=OHR.WahclellaFalls_EN-CA9749764776_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.WahclellaFalls_EN-CA9749764776","copyright":"Wahclella Falls in the Columbia River Gorge, Oregon (© Eric Vogt/Tandem Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Wahclella+Falls+Oregon&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240306_0500%22","title":"Get your splash on","caption":"Wahclella Falls, Oregon, USA","copyrightonly":"© Eric Vogt/Tandem Stills + Motion","desc":"At the end of a slot canyon in Oregon, there's something special awaiting hikers: the Wahclella Falls.

No, not like this Eurasian red squirrel; rather, that's the term for anyone born on leap day! A leap year is a calendar oddity that exists because Earth's orbit and our usual year count are slightly out of sync. Earth takes 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds, to revolve around the sun. To compensate for those extra 5 hours, February gets an extra day—leap day—every four years. The concept, dating back to the ancient Romans, was refined in the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. While the purpose of the day is to keep our year aligned with the solar calendar, it can also serve as an extra day to prepare for spring! Cultures worldwide mark leap days and years with unique customs. In Ireland and Britain, women propose to men, in Greece, marrying during a leap year is said to bring misfortune, and in France, a satirical newspaper is published.","date":"Feb. 29, 2024","bsTitle":"Leaping through an extra day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240229_LeapingSquirrel%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"cee1a2304d17657c6170d1000b1b1f45","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LeapingSquirrel_EN-CA7454002692_tmb.jpg","title":"Leap Day","desc":"Are you a 'leapling?'
