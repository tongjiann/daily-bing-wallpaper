After a gestation period of around 11 months, females give birth to a single baby—known as a chulengo—which is able to stand and walk within an hour of birth. Their diet, consisting of grasses, shrubs and lichens, enables them to flourish in harsh, mountainous terrain. Guanaco's soft, warm fur—first introduced for textile use in the mid-1900s—is highly prized.
