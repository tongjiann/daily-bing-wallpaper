During the summer months, the park becomes a bustling hub of wildlife activity, with Indian elephants frequently spotted roaming in herds numbering several hundred. As part of the Terai Arc Landscape Programme, the park is among the thirteen protected areas targeted for preservation and restoration. The overarching goal of this programme is ambitious yet crucial: to safeguard three of the most iconic terrestrial species, namely the tiger, the Asian elephant and the great one-horned rhinoceros.","date":"18 Dec 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241218_MorningElephants%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"df4824efe1696f321a0b6e68709c953b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MorningElephants_ROW5412442915_tmb.jpg","title":"Jim Corbett National Park, India","desc":"Hold onto your hats and binoculars, because in Jim Corbett National Park, the river is no ordinary waterway—it's an elephant expressway…","hash":"HJNNz/N96FErGnm0MqFztCG32lckCr8ZQxxknq2wrlc="}},{"startdate":"20241217","fullstartdate":"202412170800","enddate":"20241218","url":"/th?id=OHR.ReinefjordenNorway_ROW3919642551_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ReinefjordenNorway_ROW3919642551","copyright":"Traditional red fishermen's cabins on the shore of Reinefjorden, Norway (© Pilat666/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Lofoten+Norway&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220241217_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Reine, Norway","copyrightonly":"© Pilat666/Getty Images","desc":"Step aside, regular beach houses—Reine's little red cabins are here to steal the show.
