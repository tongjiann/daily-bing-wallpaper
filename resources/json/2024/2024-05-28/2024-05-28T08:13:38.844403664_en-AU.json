However, there is so much more to this country. Pictured here is the Roussanou Monastery, nestled amidst the towering cliffs of a rock formation called Meteora in Thessaly, northern Greece. Legend has it that in the 14th century, a group of monks seeking refuge from political turmoil scaled these cliffs to establish their hermitages. Roussanou is one of the six remaining monasteries in the Meteora UNESCO World Heritage Site. Once you've conquered the climb, you'll be greeted by stunning panoramic views, but the real treasures lie within the monastery itself—a world of Byzantine art and architecture. This style emerged in the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire, which lasted from the 4th century CE until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. So, are you ready to take the climb?","date":"28 May 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240528_MeteoraMonastery%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7fca8aa9fef0f5c8b60a1b22c0c85911","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MeteoraMonastery_ROW7444671796_tmb.jpg","title":"The Monastery of Roussanou","desc":"When you think of Greece, you might picture sea, sandy shores, whitewashed buildings and blue domes.

Lupines, with their characteristic spiky blooms in purple, blue and white, and balsamroot, with its large, golden-yellow flowers, create a picturesque contrast with the rugged mountain backdrop. These flowers also play crucial roles in the valley's ecosystem. Lupines are nitrogen-fixing plants; they help improve soil fertility by converting atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be used by neighbouring plants. Balsamroot, on the other hand, attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies, which helps in plant reproduction and, in turn, contributes to the biodiversity of the region. Whether you're a seasoned botanist or nature enthusiast, the wildflowers of the Methow Valley will surely leave a lasting impression of the enchanting wilderness.","date":"26 May 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240526_MethowWildflowers%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6dc6db93991ebb7c9916df135c760fe0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MethowWildflowers_ROW7050113422_tmb.jpg","title":"Methow Valley, North Cascades, Washington, USA","desc":"If you're looking for meadows blanketed with vibrant beds of wildflowers, the Methow Valley in the North Cascade Mountains, Washington, USA…","hash":"rNbI0dUCnQNIylM9+8j8HTHikJy3FmYnE9QmSgR+oq8="}},{"startdate":"20240525","fullstartdate":"202405250700","enddate":"20240526","url":"/th?id=OHR.MoroccoBenhaddou_ROW5693567998_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.MoroccoBenhaddou_ROW5693567998","copyright":"Aït Benhaddou, Morocco (© Grant Faint/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Ait+BenHaddou+Morocco&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240525_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Aït Benhaddou, Morocco","copyrightonly":"© Grant Faint/Getty Images","desc":"Are you looking for sandy charms?
