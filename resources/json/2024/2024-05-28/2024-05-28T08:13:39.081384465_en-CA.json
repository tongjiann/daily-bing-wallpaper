Queen Victoria reigned from 1837 to 1901, and this holiday was established in 1845. The traditional ceremony begins in New Westminster with a 21-gun salute followed by the playing of the national anthem. Although it is observed differently across the country, Parliament Hill in Ottawa hosts the Trooping the Colour, a ceremony held to mark the official birthday of the former British Sovereign. Throughout the day various events are organised, including concerts and cultural performances.

Here, ancient buildings stand along the coastline of the Ligurian Sea, and life is filled with the hustle and bustle of fishermen. Vernazza got its name from the indigenous wine, 'Vernaccia,' meaning 'local' or 'ours.' One of the best-known monuments in the area is Doria Castle, built in the 15th century as a defensive fortress to protect the village from frequent pirate attacks. Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The cobblestone streets and absence of cars make it ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio. Did you know that this region inspired the 2021 animated movie 'Luca'?
