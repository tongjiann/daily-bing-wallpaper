Measuring 38 to 40 centimetres long and weighing approximately 225 – 455 grams, this bird is a wonder of nature's design. Both male and female aracaris share the same dazzling appearance. These birds circle through the air in groups of 6 to 15 and at night, they snuggle together in tree cavities. Their song is as unique as their look—a sharp 'seek' or a whimsical 'pink,' sometimes a purring sound or even a raspy 'grhhrr.' Although deforestation and hunting pose threats to these birds, they are currently classified as a least-concern species. For now, collared aracaris remain a captivating sight, a splash of colour and a burst of life amidst the sprawling branches.","date":"10 Jul 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240710_CollaredAracari%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"65d92130f6208f55f0c7a38c19a3a481","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CollaredAracari_ROW9660042641_tmb.jpg","title":"Collared aracari","desc":"Black and yellow plumage, bright eyes and an oversized bill—meet the collared aracari, a fascinating tropical bird.
