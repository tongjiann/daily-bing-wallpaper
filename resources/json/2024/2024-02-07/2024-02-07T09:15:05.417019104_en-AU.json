While all zebras have the iconic black-and-white stripes, there are actually three different species of zebras: plains, mountain and Grévy's zebras. Today's snapshot shows Burchell's zebras, a subspecies of the plains zebra, in Rietvlei Nature Reserve, South Africa. Found across eastern and southern Africa, zebras thrive in savannas, shrublands, woodlands and even mountain regions. They spend most of their time eating—grasses, leaves and shrubs are their favourites—and have been known to travel hundreds of kilometres in search of food and water. Sadly, all three varieties of zebra are under threat from hunting and habitat destruction, however, concentrated conservation efforts can secure a brighter future for zebras and their natural habitats.","date":"31 Jan 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240131_ZebraMother%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"07479d66634b231ece3d7b868df6972d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ZebraMother_ROW2434223512_tmb.jpg","title":"Burchell's zebras","desc":"It's time for some black-and-white thinking.
