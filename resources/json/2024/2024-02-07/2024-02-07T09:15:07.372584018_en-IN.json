Found across eastern and southern Africa, zebras thrive in savannas, shrublands, woodlands and even mountain regions. They spend most of their time eating—grasses, leaves and shrubs are their favourites—and have been known to travel hundreds of kilometres in search of food and water.","date":"Jan 31, 2024","bsTitle":"Stripe a pose","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240130_ZebraMother%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9f6013f3e8067193d16014e56952ad81","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ZebraMother_EN-IN5092330040_tmb.jpg","title":"Rietvlei Nature Reserve, South Africa","desc":"It's time for some black-and-white thinking.
