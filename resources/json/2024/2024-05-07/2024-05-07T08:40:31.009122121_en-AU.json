Brittlebushes produce bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters at the ends of their branches, adding a splash of colour to the desert landscape. Another drought-loving desert flora is the saguaro cactus, which can live for over 150 years and grow up to 12 metres tall. These cacti offer food and shelter to desert species.
