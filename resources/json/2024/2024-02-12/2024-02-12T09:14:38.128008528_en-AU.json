They gracefully descend upon Southern California, gathering in large numbers on eucalyptus trees. The best place to spot these insects is in the city of Goleta, situated in southern Santa Barbara County. Those gathered to see the clumps of butterflies in 30-metre-tall trees might confuse them for clumps of leaves, however, as the sun's rays gently fall upon the insects, their wings will begin to flutter. Bring your binoculars and take the opportunity to witness these winged wonders huddled together, it's truly a sight to behold!","date":"5 Feb 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240205_WesternMonarchs%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"35b64eeae1243882d66b00dce810ae8c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WesternMonarchs_ROW4483453788_tmb.jpg","title":"Monarch butterflies","desc":"Around this time of year, beautiful, flame-coloured monarch butterflies finish their long migration that starts hundreds of kilometres north…","hash":"Bc1hsq3f7YJW2ZP7NHH3xqpSduuFx1pl+O2+o6dSLKU="}},{"startdate":"20240204","fullstartdate":"202402040800","enddate":"20240205","url":"/th?id=OHR.DevetashkaCave_ROW3161324044_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.DevetashkaCave_ROW3161324044","copyright":"Devetashka Cave, Devetaki, Bulgaria (© Jasmine_K/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Devetashka+Cave+Devetaki+Bulgaria&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240204_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Devetashka Cave, Devetaki, Bulgaria","copyrightonly":"© Jasmine_K/Shutterstock","desc":"Step into the depths of Devetashka Cave and journey through time in one of Bulgaria's many natural wonders.

They engage in communication with one another through a range of auditory signals, including whistles, screams and teeth chattering.
