They first popped up on Brighton's coastline in 1860, providing a modest cover for bathers swapping for their bathing suits. Worn out and damaged during the post-World War I depression, the beach huts received collective maintenance in 1934. Despite the upkeep, the multicoloured structures were faced with the threat of removal in 1952.

For a couple of weeks in February, if the skies are clear, the water is flowing and the sun shines at just the right angle, the long, slender waterfall takes on a glowing, flame-hued appearance. Hundreds gather in Yosemite Valley to observe this mesmerising natural occurrence, to the point where finding a space to watch from can be a challenge. This phenomenon has earned the moniker 'firefall,' a homage to the historic Yosemite Firefall, a manmade event that was organised in the park from 1872 to 1968. Eventually, park rangers decided that dumping embers over a cliff onto the land below wasn't the brightest idea.","date":"Feb. 21, 2024","bsTitle":"A natural oxymoron","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240221_YosemiteFirefall%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b5db37a90c17f204699444cf849e19dc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YosemiteFirefall_EN-CA1150407623_tmb.jpg","title":"Firefall at Yosemite","desc":"Fancy witnessing a fiery waterfall?

In 1932, this area was the stage for a historic mass trespass, where hundreds of people on foot protested for public access to these lands.
