If so, you've got a friend in the northern hawk-owl, one of the world's few owls that is only active during the day. This vocal bird inhabits the boreal forests of North America and Eurasia and has different calls for mating, communicating with young and announcing that danger is nearby. Northern hawk-owls aren't picky eaters, they'll consume mice, rats, voles, lemmings, rabbits, shrews, moles, occasionally other small birds and have even been seen eating frogs and fish. No worries, we're not on the menu, but if you wander too close to their nest, protective parents have been known to swoop at humans to keep them away.","date":"Jan. 26, 2024","bsTitle":"Not a night owl","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240126_HawkOwl%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"220cd497e90b67782d11f2204912c4f8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HawkOwl_EN-CA9957367188_tmb.jpg","title":"Northern hawk-owl","desc":"Do you find yourself thriving in the daytime while your friends love to stay out late?

The snowy owl's thick feather coat, complete with a layer of downy under plumage, provides unmatched insulation against the biting cold. With keen yellow eyes and tufted feathers, these large raptors display exceptional predatory skills. The nocturnal predators mainly consume small mammals such as lemmings, a favourite of theirs. The nomadic birds rarely breed at the same location or with the same mate.
