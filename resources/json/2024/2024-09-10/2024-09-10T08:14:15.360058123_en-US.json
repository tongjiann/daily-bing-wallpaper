To reverse this trend, Zahniser wrote most of what became the Wilderness Act. Signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964, today it protects more than 109 million acres—5% of the land in the US.","date":"Sep 3, 2024","bsTitle":"Unspoiled beauty for all","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240903_AlpineLakes%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2ed67354ce424a57e231e3e8a35a2fb8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AlpineLakes_EN-US9676616320_tmb.jpg","title":"Wilderness Act anniversary","desc":"Sometimes it's nice to get away.
