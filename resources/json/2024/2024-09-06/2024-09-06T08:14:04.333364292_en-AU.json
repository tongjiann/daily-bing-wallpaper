As the world's largest fish, these gentle giants can grow up to 12 metres, with one reaching a record 18.8 metres. Found in tropical oceans around the world, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouth wide open, straining plankton and small fish. Each pattern on their dotted, starry skin is as unique as a human fingerprint. Sadly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists whale sharks as endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss and climate change. Amid adversity, there's hope, like in Cenderawasih Bay in Indonesia, a whale shark oasis that's pictured here. Here, these titans dine on the generosity of fishermen who feed them baitfish for luck, reflecting a unique bond between man and marine life.","date":"30 Aug 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240830_WhaleSharkDay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"99b419415d3e8c7d7a31584222fd192b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WhaleSharkDay_ROW6113482072_tmb.jpg","title":"Whale shark","desc":"Whale sharks have been around for more than 240 million years, but the first specimen was discovered off the coast of South Africa in the…","hash":"GVpbySYqWx+1LUMdAsPy1bOpg+in1Gfhnvzu+tc7vCQ="}},{"startdate":"20240829","fullstartdate":"202408290700","enddate":"20240830","url":"/th?id=OHR.CastellfollitSpain_ROW5434874664_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.CastellfollitSpain_ROW5434874664","copyright":"Castellfollit de la Roca, Catalonia, Spain (© Eloi_Omella/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Castellfollit+de+la+Roca+Spain&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240829_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Castellfollit de la Roca, Catalonia, Spain","copyrightonly":"© Eloi_Omella/Getty Images","desc":"Perched on the edge of a basalt cliff, a town peers at the river running below.

These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to 6 metres and weighing more than 450 kilograms. What sets them apart is their dark green colour, which helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping their prey's populations under control. Fewer caimans mean more piranhas, which attack cattle, and more capybaras, which cause crop damage.","date":"27 Aug 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240827_YoungCaiman%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a112b29308b32d94851c67695dbca289","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YoungCaiman_ROW5014887226_tmb.jpg","title":"Young black caiman","desc":"Today's image features a black caiman, South America's stealthy river giant, in the Tambopata National Reserve, Peru.

Spanning approximately 4,100 square kilometres, this park protects animals such as grizzly bears, moose, elks and mountain goats. Glacier National Park also houses the Going-to-the-Sun Road, more than 1,120 kilometres of trails and the awe-inspiring vistas of Swiftcurrent Lake, seen in today's image.
