National Panda Day, observed on March 16, helps to raise awareness about panda conservation and their fight for survival amid the destruction of their natural habitat. To curb the threat, the Chinese government built more than 50 reserves and by 2016, pandas were reclassified from an endangered to a vulnerable species.

In addition, as a designated International Dark Sky Park, it is an exceptional spot for stargazing.

Every March 14, mathematics fans across the world get baking to mark Pi Day with a pie. It began in 1988, when physicist Larry Shaw connected the date (3/14) with the first three digits of π. Today, mathematicians and enthusiasts celebrate Pi Day with pie eating and pi reciting. Did you know that when your clock strikes 1:59 today, you will be three decimal places closer to the real value of pi? Pi is everywhere, even in nature.
