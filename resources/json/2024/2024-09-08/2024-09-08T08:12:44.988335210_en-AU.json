The Abbey of Saint-Martin du Canigou opens its doors to you! Nestled in the western foothills of the Canigou massif in the Pyrénées-Orientales, this is an eleventh-century Romanesque marvel. The abbey has two churches built in the first Romanesque style: the lower church, dedicated to St. Mary, and the upper church, dedicated to St. Martin. This historic structure is catalogued in the Base Mérimée, an architectural heritage database managed by the French Ministry of Culture. The original appearance of the cloister is now hard to envision due to extensive restorations carried out between 1900 and 1920. Originally, the cloister had two levels: the lower level, constructed in the early 11th century, featured vaulted galleries with semicircular arches and was free of ornamentation. Today, only three heavily restored galleries remain, missing much of their original character.","date":"8 Sep 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240908_Canigou%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9670fea37420d0b2c842451b820e7aaa","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Canigou_ROW3533660009_tmb.jpg","title":"Abbey of Saint-Martin-du-Canigou","desc":"Looking for a timeless getaway?

Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backwards. Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects.","date":"7 Sep 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240907_SantaCruzHummer%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5d213fe2960a50d32a2840b6a868549d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SantaCruzHummer_ROW3345595068_tmb.jpg","title":"Anna's hummingbird","desc":"Let's meet Anna's hummingbird, seen in today's image.
