The presence of humans in Devetashka Cave is thought to date back to the Early Stone Age, around 70,000 years BCE, and Neolithic artefacts from 6,000-4,000 BCE have been found here.

Over the course of the festivities, thousands of people take to the streets in elaborate costumes that imitate traditional 17th-century Venetian clothes. There are parades, parties and processions galore during the carnival, along with concerts and street performances, all of which last until Shrove Tuesday, which falls on February 13 this year. While revelling in the streets, you might pass by the Santa Maria della Salute, seen towards the back of today's image, a baroque basilica dedicated to the Virgin Mary, who was considered to be the protector of the Republic of Venice.","date":"Feb. 3, 2024","bsTitle":"Days of disguises","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240203_VeniceCarnival%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9cd01f7b35a1b973092fc94c2b1c373e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VeniceCarnival_EN-CA6952595952_tmb.jpg","title":"Carnival of Venice","desc":"Don your tricorn hat and gilded disguise, it's time to visit the Carnival of Venice, a centuries-old festival shrouded in mystique and…","hash":"3s3t3+U28WLgcl8jLoe+9OpzlPWdEGeoHUXBYGUG/Kk="}},{"startdate":"20240202","fullstartdate":"202402020500","enddate":"20240203","url":"/th?id=OHR.AlpineMarmot_EN-CA0148441892_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.AlpineMarmot_EN-CA0148441892","copyright":"Marmot peeking out of its burrow (© Scacciamosche/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Groundhog+Day+holiday&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240202_0500%22","title":"Will Willie see his shadow?","caption":"Groundhog Day","copyrightonly":"© Scacciamosche/Getty Images","desc":"Curious about how long this winter will last?

Once the prediction is made, it is read to the crowd, who cheer Willie on either way. The original Willie passed away in 1999, and since then, the celebration has been held with a successor to the original Willie. A relative of Willie's, the Alpine marmot seen here today, has its own winter tradition of stocking up on food to prepare for a long hibernation.

Today's snapshot shows Burchell's zebras, a subspecies of the plains zebra, in Rietvlei Nature Reserve, South Africa. Found across eastern and southern Africa, zebras thrive in savannas, shrublands, woodlands and even mountain regions. They spend most of their time eating—grasses, leaves and shrubs are their favourites—and have been known to travel hundreds of kilometres in search of food and water.
