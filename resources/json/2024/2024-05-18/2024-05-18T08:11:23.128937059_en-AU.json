Just like a human mom, a guanaco female is fiercely protective of her child, also known as 'chulengo.' They give birth to chulengos, who are born after a gestation period of about 11 months. At birth, chulengos are precocial, meaning they are relatively mature and mobile, able to stand and walk shortly after they’re born. Adults stand around 110 centimetres tall, weighing approximately 90 kilograms. After a year of wandering along with the herd, the male guanaco is chased off by the dominant male of the herd.

Typically found in North America, Central America and northern South America, these little creatures are around 11.5 - 15 centimetres long with a wingspan of between 18 - 23 centimetres. The indigo bunting's musical vocalisations, a delightful series of rapid, jumbled warbles, signal the onset of their breeding season in late April or May.
