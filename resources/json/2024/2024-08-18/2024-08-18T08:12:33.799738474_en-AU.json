The park's namesake, the Joshua tree, grows in a landscape covering 3,216 square kilometres. Despite their name, they are not really trees but rather a kind of succulent. Native to the southwest US and northern Mexico, they can grow up to 12 metres tall. Whether it's hiking through Hidden Valley, visiting the Cholla Cactus Garden or marvelling at Skull Rock, this national park has a lot to offer.

After the Inca Empire was defeated at a battle here in 1536, Sacsayhuamán was dismantled by the Spanish, and the rest of the structure was covered in earth.
