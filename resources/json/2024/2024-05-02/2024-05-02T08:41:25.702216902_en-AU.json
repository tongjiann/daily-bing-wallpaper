In 1840, the French adventurer Jules Dumont d'Urville discovered the Adélie penguins and honoured his wife, Adèle Dorothée, by naming them after her. Despite their small size, Adélie penguins are sleek swimmers and can dive as deep as 175 metres in search of shrimp-like krill or fish. They are social animals which gather in small colonies for foraging, hunting and protection. While it may seem mischievous, Adélies steal pebbles from nearby nests to strengthen their own, safeguarding their eggs and chicks from Antarctica's harsh conditions and predators.","date":"25 Apr 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240425_PenguinDirections%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c0c04f29a4521f2d011c121ecf62a2c3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PenguinDirections_ROW6068670140_tmb.jpg","title":"Adélie penguins, Antarctica","desc":"Why fly when you can slide?
