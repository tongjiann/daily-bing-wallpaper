Visitors are greeted by a surreal vista of vast lava fields, cinder cones and spatter cones, reminiscent of a lunar surface, spread across almost 21,853 hectares. Did you know that the Apollo 14 astronauts trained here to prepare for their moon missions? The space travellers were able gain insight into similar conditions found on the moon by exploring the unique volcanic geology of the Craters of the Moon. So, if you ever want to visit outer space without leaving Earth, Craters of the Moon should be right up your alley.","date":"2 May 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240502_CratersOfTheMoon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"81282d3777c79fb0b5ecfe0751fb8b3d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CratersOfTheMoon_ROW5553418734_tmb.jpg","title":"Craters of the Moon National Monument, Idaho, USA","desc":"Buckle up, Earthlings, as you venture into an extraterrestrial realm right here on our planet!
