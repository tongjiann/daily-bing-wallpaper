This national park has more than 700 lakes, two mountain ranges and vast forests teeming with life, earning it the moniker 'Crown of the Continent.' With its 25 glaciers, it's a vital study ground for scientists monitoring climate change, who have warned that glaciers might disappear by 2030. Spanning approximately 4,100 square kilometres, this park protects animals such as grizzly bears, moose, elk and mountain goats. Glacier National Park also houses the Going-to-the-Sun Road, more than 1,120 kilometres of trails and the awe-inspiring vistas of Swiftcurrent Lake, seen in today's image. The park's ancient cedar forests and crystalline waterfalls capture the essence of the untamed wilderness, inviting all who seek peace and adventure within its bounds.","date":"Aug. 25, 2024","bsTitle":"Preserving paradise","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240825_SwiftcurrentLake%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2db85f25d9be86ad5062d95f1438a6c9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SwiftcurrentLake_EN-CA7830300836_tmb.jpg","title":"Glacier National Park, Montana, USA","desc":"Join us as we explore Glacier National Park in Montana, United States, established in 1910.
