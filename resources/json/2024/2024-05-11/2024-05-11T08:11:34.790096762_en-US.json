This UNESCO World Heritage Site appears in the movies as the planet Ahch-To, where Jedi master Luke Skywalker seeks refuge. Home to a 6th-century monastery with beehive huts and stone staircases, it also hosts a large seabird population that inspired the penguin-like porgs that roost on Ahch-To. Skellig Michael is about 7 miles off Ireland's southwestern coast, daily visitors are limited, and boat trips are canceled if it is too stormy. Still, the island attracts 'Star Wars' fans and others keen to see this ancient site, not so very far, far away.","date":"May 4, 2024","bsTitle":"May the Fourth be with you!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240504_JediMonastery%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"606ff54b1d6c852b2982b30474424299","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JediMonastery_EN-US9398447907_tmb.jpg","title":"'Star Wars' Day","desc":"May the Force be with you on May 4, adopted by 'Star Wars' fans as the day to celebrate their favorite franchise.

Another drought-loving desert flora is the saguaro cactus, which can live for over 150 years and grow up to 40 feet tall.

Birds come in a wide range of sizes, colors, and behaviors, making them one of the most diverse groups of animals on Earth—from imposing eagles to today's tiny snowy-winged star, a leucistic Anna's hummingbird in the Australian Garden at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum. These hummingbirds are typically vibrant in color, but leucism means some have decreased pigmentation, resulting in a paler appearance. Unlike albino birds, these hummingbirds do not have red or pink eyes. Their lighter plumage reduces protective camouflage, making them more vulnerable to predators such as hawks and feral cats.","date":"Apr 27, 2024","bsTitle":"Stop!
