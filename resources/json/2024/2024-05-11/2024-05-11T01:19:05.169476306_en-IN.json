Today's image flashes out a filming location from the 'Star Wars' sequel trilogy, the island of Skellig Michael, off the coast of southwestern Ireland. This UNESCO World Heritage landmark houses a preserved monastery from the 6th century, founded by early monks. The site's beehive huts and stone staircases were showcased as the backdrop of a cloistered island on planet Ahch-To, where Jedi Master Luke Skywalker sought refuge in 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens.' Skellig Michael's abundant seabird population, including puffins, inspired the creation of the penguin-like porgs that roost on Ahch-To.

These hardy shrubs seen here are adapted to the dry climate, with their silvery-grey leaves covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Brittlebushes produce bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters at the ends of their branches, adding a splash of colour to the desert landscape. Another drought-loving desert flora is the saguaro cactus, which can live for over 150 years and grow up to 12 metres tall. These cacti offer food and shelter to desert species. The saguaro is also a sacred plant in the culture of the Tohono O'odham people, used for sustenance and rituals.","date":"May 3, 2024","bsTitle":"Even the hottest places are cool!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240502_SonoranSpring%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"17bda9f995d3514ea3661820f1131695","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SonoranSpring_EN-IN9627232224_tmb.jpg","title":"The Sonoran Desert, Arizona, US","desc":"You know you're in the Sonoran Desert, Arizona, in the US, when the sun gives you a warm 'welcome'!

These hummingbirds are typically vibrant in colour, but leucism means that they have decreased pigmentation, resulting in a paler appearance. Unlike albino birds, these hummingbirds retain some colour in their eyes. They are equipped with specialised adaptations like a long tongue for feeding on nectar from flowers. However, their diet is not limited to nectar alone; they also supplement their nutrition by consuming small insects and other arthropods. Their lighter plumage reduces protective camouflage, making them more vulnerable to predators such as hawks and feral cats.","date":"Apr 27, 2024","bsTitle":"Stop, it's hummer time!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240426_LeucisticHummingbird%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4e4c42288cb4ec546d2b5e0585381925","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LeucisticHummingbird_EN-IN0052515058_tmb.jpg","title":"Leucistic Anna's Hummingbird","desc":"Get your binoculars and field guide and head to a local park to spot a hummingbird!
