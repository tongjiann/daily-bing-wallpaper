This arid land is home to various animals such as roadrunners, Gila monsters, and the Morafka's tortoise. The Sonoran Desert experiences two rainy seasons, which leads to the blossoming of colourful wildflowers such as the brittlebush, seen in today's image. These hardy shrubs seen here are adapted to the dry climate, with their silvery-grey leaves covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Brittlebushes produce bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters at the ends of their branches, adding a splash of colour to the desert landscape. Another drought-loving desert flora is the saguaro cactus, which can live for over 150 years and grow up to 12 metres tall. These cacti offer food and shelter to desert species. The saguaro is also a sacred plant in the culture of the Tohono O'odham people, used for sustenance and rituals.","date":"3 May 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240503_SonoranSpring%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4a9dac0973fb85e638524d49ff498f5c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SonoranSpring_ROW6193014422_tmb.jpg","title":"The Sonoran Desert, Arizona, USA","desc":"You know you're in the Sonoran Desert, Arizona, USA, when the sun gives you a warm 'welcome'!
