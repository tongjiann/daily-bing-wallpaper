Native to eastern North America, this spring species is one of the most common woodland wildflowers. Unlike some impulsive blossoms that burst into colour at the slightest hint of warmth, this plant is a slow bloomer. From gracing US postage stamps to being the state wildflower of Ohio and an official symbol of Canada's Ontario, the white trillium is ingrained in our culture. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the plant has earned its stripes in the world of herbal medicine.

Lying on a narrow strip of land between two lochs, the site initially comprised 60 stones, although today only 36 remain. The exact purpose of the structure is still unknown; in 2008, an excavation project called the Ring of Brodgar Excavation was undertaken to try to learn more about the site, but the project has not yet reached any conclusive results.
