While she shares the distinctive crest and red bill with the male, her plumage is a more subdued yellowish, cinnamon-brown, adorned only with subtle touches of red. Unlike females in many bird species, the female cardinal is an accomplished vocalist, harmonising with the melodies of the male.","date":"16 Feb 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240216_BackyardBird%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0e54feb136ecfca8b65ed47b1e167674","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BackyardBird_ROW2069245060_tmb.jpg","title":"Pyrrhuloxia bird","desc":"In today's image is a pyrrhuloxia—also known as the desert cardinal—a songbird that lives in the deserts of northern Mexico and the American…","hash":"N1UY/DdRWVGAsvDBcTXxvu7REXMtd8WW8Vtr9K/4tXU="}},{"startdate":"20240215","fullstartdate":"202402150800","enddate":"20240216","url":"/th?id=OHR.HippopotamusDay_ROW6289598676_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.HippopotamusDay_ROW6289598676","copyright":"Hippopotamus mother and calf, South Luangwa National Park, Zambia (© Nature Picture Library/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Hippopotamus&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240215_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Hippopotamus","copyrightonly":"© Nature Picture Library/Alamy","desc":"All eyes are on hippopotamuses today!

One of the species examined in the study was the Galápagos giant tortoise, a tortoise only found on the Galápagos Islands, that can grow up to 2 metres long and weigh over 270 kilograms.

It later came to be ruled by Athens. During this period, there was a polis or city state, on the island, called Pholegandros. This city state stood where the modern capital, Chora—seen in today's image—is located. Chora is perched on the edge of a 200-metre cliff and offers a bird's-eye view of its beautiful surroundings.
