Sparkling strings of lights drape across the square, seen in today's image, creating a canopy that bathes the cobblestone streets in a warm, festive glow. There also stands a beautifully lit Christmas tree, surrounded by charming wooden huts selling everything from handcrafted ornaments to locally made treats like cozonac, a traditional Romanian sweet bread; vin fiert, an aromatic mulled wine; and covrigi, a type of pretzel served warm and sprinkled with salt.","date":"Dec 19, 2024","bsTitle":"Twinkle town","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241218_SibiuRomania%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"89c115f39cb4a52613b8a6b60f31b7ed","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SibiuRomania_EN-IN1994356758_tmb.jpg","title":"Sibiu Christmas Market, Romania","desc":"As the winter chill sets in, the city of Sibiu transforms into a dazzling holiday wonderland as it hosts one of Romania's most popular…","hash":"DfXiOvMH1Ge9sD6fmJrXDR+Bn+JRgSBL4h8AuzwlOMw="}},{"startdate":"20241217","fullstartdate":"202412171830","enddate":"20241218","url":"/th?id=OHR.NutcrackerBallet_EN-IN5416156608_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.NutcrackerBallet_EN-IN5416156608","copyright":"English National Ballet performing 'The Nutcracker' (© Caroline Holden/Alamy Stock Photo)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=The+Nutcracker+ballet&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220241217_1830%22","title":"Yule really loves this ballet","caption":"English National Ballet performing 'The Nutcracker'","copyrightonly":"© Caroline Holden/Alamy Stock Photo","desc":"Every holiday season, as snow begins to fall and Christmas lights twinkle in the night, the story of 'The Nutcracker' comes to life on stages around the world.

Set on Christmas Eve, it follows a young girl named Clara, who goes on an adventure with the Nutcracker Prince as they battle the evil Mouse King. Many renowned ballet companies present their rendition of this classic every year, including the New York City Ballet, the Boston Ballet and the English National Ballet, pictured here. Tchaikovsky's score is noted for its use of the celesta, an instrument with a bell-like tone, which perfectly captures the fairy-tale atmosphere.","date":"Dec 18, 2024","bsTitle":"Yule really loves this ballet","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241217_NutcrackerBallet%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"7fd19d0e6c81e32b0e1a23dba1464d39","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NutcrackerBallet_EN-IN5416156608_tmb.jpg","title":"English National Ballet performing 'The Nutcracker'","desc":"Every holiday season, as snow begins to fall and Christmas lights twinkle in the night, the story of 'The Nutcracker' comes to life on…","hash":"kq3lrLfaJSuDR1mO1jPOdiY9D6P/POmoO/++OwdI/zw="}},{"startdate":"20241216","fullstartdate":"202412161830","enddate":"20241217","url":"/th?id=OHR.ReinefjordenNorway_EN-IN1479907327_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.ReinefjordenNorway_EN-IN1479907327","copyright":"Traditional red fishermen's cabins on the shore of Reinefjorden, Norway (© Pilat666/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Lofoten+Norway&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220241216_1830%22","title":"A shore to adore","caption":"Traditional red fishermen's cabins, Reine, Norway","copyrightonly":"© Pilat666/Getty Images","desc":"Step aside, regular beach houses—Reine's little red cabins are here to steal the show.

The village's waterfront is lined with the traditional fishermen's cabins called rorbu or rorbuer, which are mostly red in colour, as seen in today's image. Once important to fishermen, these cabins have now become a popular pick for tourist rentals. In 1999, German painter Ingo Kühl set up a pop-up studio in a rorbu in Reine, where he painted scenes of the harbour framed by the towering mountain range.
