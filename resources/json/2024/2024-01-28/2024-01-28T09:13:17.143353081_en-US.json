The huge flat area is transformed from a parched desert canvas to a vibrant tapestry of wildflowers when rainfall is abundant. Indigenous Australians have lived off this land for tens of thousands of years and some offer tours and classes about how to survive in the Outback. This unspoiled region is also home to a bonanza of wildlife—kangaroos that bounce along the plains, strutting emus, and preening purple-crowned fairywrens. If you're lucky, you might even spot a bilby—a nocturnal marsupial with rabbit-like ears.

This annual celebration, taking place between January 25 and February 4 this year, transforms Minnesota's capital city into a winter wonderland. It all started in 1885, when a group of reporters visited and referred to Minnesota as another Siberia, unfit for human habitation. This offended city officials who devised a plan to showcase the area's winter beauty. The Winter Carnival was born, featuring seasonal activities such as bobsledding and ice horse-racing. Today, the carnival attracts visitors and strengthens community bonds through parades, markets, and winter sports. And ice sculptors carve stunning but fleeting works of art, like the frozen palace towering over today's image.","date":"Jan 27, 2024","bsTitle":"In winter's embrace","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240127_WinterCarnival%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"22396b0435446db8fec7ad36edb9eb48","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WinterCarnival_EN-US6859361078_tmb.jpg","title":"St. Paul Winter Carnival","desc":"A chilly paradise awaits at the St. Paul Winter Carnival!
