This sprawling area is famous for its crisscrossing river channels and its transformation from a parched desert canvas to a vibrant tapestry of wildflowers when rainfall is abundant. Indigenous Australians have lived off this land for tens of thousands of years, and some in the area offer tours and classes that teach visitors how to survive in the Outback. This unspoiled region is also home to a bonanza of wildlife—kangaroos that bounce along the plains, emus that strut their stuff and preening purple-crowned fairywrens. If you're lucky, you might even spot a bilby—a nocturnal marsupial that has rabbit-like long ears.

In 1885, a group of reporters visited and referred to Minnesota as another Siberia, which offended city officials. As a response, they devised a plan to showcase the area's winter beauty. The Winter Carnival was born, featuring various seasonal activities such as bobsledding and ice horse racing.

Northern hawk-owls aren't picky eaters, they'll consume mice, rats, voles, lemmings, rabbits, shrews, moles, occasionally other small birds and have even been seen eating frogs and fish.

With keen yellow eyes and tufted feathers, these large raptors display exceptional predatory skills. The nocturnal predators mainly consume small mammals such as lemmings, a favourite of theirs.
