Macaroni penguins gather in foraging groups, but males can be aggressive towards each other. To show passivity and avoid a fight, individuals often ease through colonies with their heads tucked down to their chests. Despite being beloved by us humans, penguins are threatened by reduced food availability, errant fishing nets and the profound impact of climate change on their habitat, sea ice.","date":"Jan. 20, 2024","bsTitle":"Macaroni and freeze","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240120_MacaroniPenguins%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"80bbf59f34b9435ee77a78ec51b99291","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MacaroniPenguins_EN-CA8464340368_tmb.jpg","title":"Macaroni penguins, Drake Passage, Chile","desc":"Let's flap our flippers and delve into knowing a bit more about penguins.

This water carries precipitated limestone, which gradually accumulates and hardens over time, creating a series of rock barriers called tufa. These barriers form pools, with thin, lacy waterfalls leading from one 'lake' to another. This majestic display of geology and hydrology draws over a million visitors to the paths and boardwalks that wind through the lakes—they are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, after all.
