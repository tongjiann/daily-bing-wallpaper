Formed over a billion years, this natural wonder features sheer cliffs rising 100 metres above the canyon floor, stretching for over two kilometres. Designated as a provincial park in 1972, this landscape preserves a unique microenvironment, hosting arctic plant species typically found 1,000 kilometres to the north. In 2022 the park celebrated 50 years of conserving this unique slice of Canadian natural heritage. The two viewing platforms on the west side provide spectacular vistas of the canyon's depth and the verdant forest below. The park's incredible geology owes its existence to the last Ice Age, which left behind this awe-inspiring feature that continues to attract nature enthusiasts and photographers alike.","date":"Sep. 15, 2024","bsTitle":"A 'gorge-ous' adventure","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240915_OuimetCanyon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f7216e0f8cae3b07190522a167028ca8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OuimetCanyon_EN-CA0342113199_tmb.jpg","title":"Ouimet Canyon in the Ouimet Canyon Provincial Park","desc":"Explore the Ouimet Canyon, seen in today's image, a remarkable geological formation in the Ouimet Canyon Provincial Park near Thunder Bay…","hash":"w+x9HoJdIBeiSz0SE3RTsV7TW1oiIneah4I11Z1Milw="}},{"startdate":"20240914","fullstartdate":"202409140400","enddate":"20240915","url":"/th?id=OHR.RapaNuiSunrise_EN-CA0278736669_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.RapaNuiSunrise_EN-CA0278736669","copyright":"Sunrise at Ahu Tongariki, Rapa Nui National Park, Easter Island, Chile (© Piriya Photography/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Ahu+Tongariki&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240914_0400%22","title":"Stone sentinels of Easter Island","caption":"Rapa Nui National Park, Easter Island, Chile","copyrightonly":"© Piriya Photography/Getty Images","desc":"Welcome to Rapa Nui, also known as Easter Island, Chile—one of the world's most remote and enchanting paradises.

Built to ease the traffic jam on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal, the construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge began in February 1995. It is earthquake-resistant, designed to absorb shifting during a quake. Since its deck is not fixed to the pylons, it can move both lengthwise and sideways.
