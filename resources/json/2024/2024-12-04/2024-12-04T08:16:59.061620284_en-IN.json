The name originates from a local legend about a Gallic giant, Treviso, who chose to leap off the cliffs of Rocher des Gattes rather than be captured by Roman soldiers. This vantage point, popular among hikers and road-trippers, provides a view that shifts dramatically with the seasons. During autumn, the landscape dons warm colours, as seen in today's image, making it an ideal spot for nature enthusiasts and photographers.","date":"Nov 27, 2024","bsTitle":"The giant's resting place","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241126_SemoisRiver%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ff3878fb8d95b38f9ee82c81f1d012eb","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SemoisRiver_EN-IN2471885756_tmb.jpg","title":"Tombeau du Géant in Bouillon, Belgium","desc":"Tombeau du Géant in Bouillon, Belgium, offers a picturesque panorama for those who make the journey to see it.
