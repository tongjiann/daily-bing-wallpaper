Macaroni penguins gather in foraging groups, but males can be aggressive towards each other.

This water carries precipitated limestone, which gradually accumulates and hardens over time, creating a series of rock barriers called tufa. These barriers form pools, with thin, lacy waterfalls leading from one 'lake' to another.
