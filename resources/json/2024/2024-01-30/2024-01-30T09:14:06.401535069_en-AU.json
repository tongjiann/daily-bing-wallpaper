Atolls are islands in the shape of rings with coral rims and lagoons in their centre. The Maldives is also home to the Baa Atoll Biosphere Reserve, which was granted UNESCO World Heritage Site status in June 2011. Visitors go there to spot manta rays and whale sharks and can enjoy sustainable water activities like scuba diving and surfing.","date":"23 Jan 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240123_MaldivesAtolls%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"07020cc75007ac25da5f143237797eab","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MaldivesAtolls_ROW2005051819_tmb.jpg","title":"Maldives","desc":"With serene sandy beaches and crystal-clear water, the island country of the Maldives is located to the southwest of Sri Lanka and India…","hash":"LadpUqxyWjM34tk4etFa4q8oHT49I8fEopUj+Zxtr6k="}},{"startdate":"20240122","fullstartdate":"202401220800","enddate":"20240123","url":"/th?id=OHR.SantaCruzSunrise_ROW5698055463_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.SantaCruzSunrise_ROW5698055463","copyright":"Winter sunrise, Walton Lighthouse, Santa Cruz, California (© Jeff Lewis/Tandem Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Santa+Cruz+Breakwater+Lighthouse&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240122_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Walton Lighthouse, Santa Cruz, California, USA","copyrightonly":"© Jeff Lewis/Tandem Stills + Motion","desc":"Step to the western edge of America, where Walton Lighthouse, also known as the Santa Cruz Breakwater Lighthouse, serves as a guiding beacon for passing ships.

Macaroni penguins gather in foraging groups, but males can be aggressive towards each other. To show passivity and avoid a fight, individuals often ease through colonies with their heads tucked down to their chests.

Croatia's Plitvice Lakes National Park, one of the largest and oldest in the country, provides that exact opportunity thanks to a unique geological feature. The slopes of the Mala Kapela, Medveđak and Plješevica mountains funnel water into the Plitvice plateau. This water carries precipitated limestone, which gradually accumulates and hardens over time, creating a series of rock barriers called tufa. These barriers form pools, with thin, lacy waterfalls leading from one 'lake' to another. This majestic display of geology and hydrology draws over a million visitors to the paths and boardwalks that wind through the lakes—they are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, after all. Even in the winter, the lakes retain their beauty, with once-roaring waterfalls frozen in place.","date":"19 Jan 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240119_PlitviceWinter%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"55e4a72d18b36d5bc360b1482e18647e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PlitviceWinter_ROW6330120035_tmb.jpg","title":"Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia","desc":"Why visit one lake when you can visit 16?
