Because of its snow-capped mountains during the winter months, the town is frequently called Manchegan Switzerland—with 'Manchegan' referring to the autonomous community of Castile-La Mancha that Aýna is a part of. About 240 kilometres south of the capital, Madrid, Aýna offers a unique glimpse into Spanish village life.","date":"Jan. 30, 2024","bsTitle":"Spain's little Switzerland","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240130_AlbaceteSpain%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e5bc6f0dbb307bcf05d7c4b16d28c436","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AlbaceteSpain_EN-CA6620755478_tmb.jpg","title":"Aýna, Albacete, Spain","desc":"Snow might not be the first thing that pops into your mind when thinking about Spain, but thanks to its diverse landscapes from high peaks…","hash":"ij/y2g45CX/GKx9KTg8diWk+zVwqdQrEMvfPNIe0b7Q="}},{"startdate":"20240129","fullstartdate":"202401290500","enddate":"20240130","url":"/th?id=OHR.GollingerFalls_EN-CA5492770721_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.GollingerFalls_EN-CA5492770721","copyright":"Gollinger Waterfalls, Tennengau, Salzburg, Austria (© Frank Fischbach/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Salzburg+federal+state+Austria&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240129_0500%22","title":"A gentle descent","caption":"Gollinger Waterfalls, Salzburg, Austria","copyrightonly":"© Frank Fischbach/Alamy","desc":"From the untamed Salzachöfen Gorge, to the world's oldest salt mines at Hallein, to Eisriesenwelt, the largest ice cave in the world, Austria is home to many wonders.
