Lupines, with their characteristic spiky blooms in purple, blue and white, and balsamroot, with its large, golden-yellow flowers, create a picturesque contrast with the rugged mountain backdrop. These flowers also play crucial roles in the valley's ecosystem. Lupines are nitrogen-fixing plants; they help improve soil fertility by converting atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be used by neighbouring plants. Balsamroot, on the other hand, attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies, which helps in plant reproduction and, in turn, contributes to the biodiversity of the region. Whether you're a seasoned botanist or nature enthusiast, the wildflowers of the Methow Valley will surely leave a lasting impression of the enchanting wilderness.","date":"May 26, 2024","bsTitle":"Wild and free","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240526_MethowWildflowers%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"16ddd0a75bcbb09792b4afebb8231306","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MethowWildflowers_EN-CA5562185332_tmb.jpg","title":"Methow Valley, North Cascades, Washington","desc":"If you're looking for meadows blanketed with vibrant beds of wildflowers, the Methow Valley in the North Cascade Mountains, Washington, US…","hash":"Ll4updgPZ8kCYan2tLDbpz5+S0tCmc+zgGuumJo2A40="}},{"startdate":"20240525","fullstartdate":"202405250400","enddate":"20240526","url":"/th?id=OHR.MoroccoBenhaddou_EN-CA5085608684_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.MoroccoBenhaddou_EN-CA5085608684","copyright":"Aït Benhaddou, Morocco (© Grant Faint/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Ait+BenHaddou+Morocco&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240525_0400%22","title":"Guardians of the dunes","caption":"Aït Benhaddou, Morocco","copyrightonly":"© Grant Faint/Getty Images","desc":"Are you looking for sandy charms?

Located on the gentle slopes overlooking the Asif Ounila (Ounila River) is the ksar, a fortified village of Aït Benhaddou, with mud-brick structures. Clustered within a defensive wall with a gate and corner towers, ksars are a great representation of classic pre-Saharan dwelling. The ksar's communal landscape includes a public square, a mosque, grain-threshing areas beyond the fortifications and a caravanserai—a type of roadside inn, among other features.

Although it is observed differently across the country, Parliament Hill in Ottawa hosts the Trooping the Colour, a ceremony held to mark the official birthday of the former British Sovereign.

One of the best-known monuments in the area is Doria Castle, built in the 15th century as a defensive fortress to protect the village from frequent pirate attacks. Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The cobblestone streets and absence of cars make it ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio.
