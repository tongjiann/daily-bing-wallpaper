Beyond their aesthetic appeal, they contribute to biodiversity by attracting pollinators such as bees, fostering a healthy ecosystem. While their fruits are generally smaller and more tart than those of regular apples, some varieties are cultivated for culinary purposes, including jams and jellies. Gardeners and landscapers often appreciate their versatility and use them to enhance the visual appeal of outdoor environments. Whether as stand-alone specimens or part of larger garden designs, these bring a delightful blend of natural beauty and ecological benefits to diverse settings.","date":"6 Jan 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240106_CrabappleChaffinch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"413958f5f2fd611efc2ce5913ec2e89f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CrabappleChaffinch_ROW0592693286_tmb.jpg","title":"A male chaffinch in a crab apple tree","desc":"Crab apple trees are known for their beauty and occasional harvests of small, vibrant fruits.

Blanketed by the fog above the waters of the Golden Gate Strait, its towers, adorned with Art Deco elements, reach a height of 227 metres. This bridge was the result of combined efforts put in by engineer Joseph Strauss, architect Irving Marrow and many others towards connecting San Francisco to Marin County. The bridge was painted International Orange—the golden adjective refers to the sun-reflecting waters below—and was opened to the public in 1937. It wasn't an easy vision to accomplish, especially as it was built during the Great Depression. The infrastructure investment paid off, as its construction employed thousands, contributing to both local employment and technological growth. The Golden Gate Bridge, a testament to human innovation, is a timeless masterpiece blending functionality with beauty.","date":"4 Jan 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240104_GoldenGateLight%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e3e04e48b7276e79061f950ade0efb7b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GoldenGateLight_ROW1901187150_tmb.jpg","title":"Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, California","desc":"An exemplary engineering accomplishment, the Golden Gate Bridge stands like a sentinel over the entrance to San Francisco Bay.

As the lake was dammed twice, first in 1895 and then in 1912 to reserve water for a hydroelectric plant downstream, the Minnewanka Landing settlement was submerged by the rising water levels.
