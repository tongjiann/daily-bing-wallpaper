They help keep trees, flowers and crops to stay alive, which helps secure food chains and boost biodiversity. It's no overstatement to say that bees are vital for humans' survival. Honey bees, like the one in today's image, construct nests from wax and produce a surplus amount of honey from nectar. This excess means that humans can harvest honey without endangering the bees themselves. The western honey bee is the most common species; humans have been keeping bees in artificial hives for around 10,000 years.","date":"20 May 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240520_HoneycombBee%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6c5d24396d56c52be6e64844284e05a0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HoneycombBee_ROW6367534949_tmb.jpg","title":"Bee tending a honeycomb","desc":"Check out this tiny golden chef in its natural element!

Vernazza got its name from the indigenous wine, 'vernaccia,' meaning 'local' or 'ours.' One of the best-known monuments in the area is Doria Castle, built in the 15th century as a defensive fortress to protect the village from frequent pirate attacks. Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The cobblestone streets and absence of cars make it ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio. Did you know that this region inspired the 2021 animated movie 'Luca'?
