What exactly is biodiversity? It refers to all living things, from animals and plants to fungi and microorganisms, in one area. This delicate but vigorous balance in nature is what keeps us all alive. That's definitely worth celebrating! May 22 was officially declared to be the International Day for Biological Diversity by the United Nations in 2000. Unfortunately, the biodiversity of Earth is slowly decreasing due to climate change, the draining of natural resources, urbanisation and pollution, among other factors. It is our responsibility to return nature's favour to us and protect our environment. After all, we are blessed with intriguing species such as the Tasmanian snow gum—the tree seen in today's image—which takes root in one of the most biologically diverse places on the planet, the Mount Field National Park in Tasmania, Australia.","date":"May 22, 2024","bsTitle":"Dive into diversity","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240521_SnowGumTasmania%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0d4a0fbe526195c0243b613833e91e99","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SnowGumTasmania_EN-IN6798155593_tmb.jpg","title":"International Day for Biological Diversity","desc":"Today we're celebrating the biodiversity of our planet!

Here, ancient buildings stand along the coastline of the Ligurian Sea, and life is filled with the hustle and bustle of fishermen. Vernazza got its name from the indigenous wine, 'vernaccia,' meaning 'local' or 'ours.' One of the best-known monuments in the area is Doria Castle, built in the 15th century as a defensive fortress to protect the village from frequent pirate attacks. Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The cobblestone streets and absence of cars make it ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio. Did you know that this region inspired the 2021 animated film 'Luca'?
