The longest river in the country—the Fish River—has carved out the continent's largest canyon over millions of years. Winding through weathered layers of gneiss and dolomite rocks, the Fish River Canyon is around 161 kilometres long and about 550 metres deep. This popular site attracts adventure seekers with its hiking trail, which runs for over 80 kilomtres. Moreover, with Hartmann's mountain zebras, klipspringers and Eastern rock elephant shrews, the canyon is teeming with creatures big and small. So, whether you are there for hiking, trekking, camping or just soaking in the scenery, one thing's for sure: Fish River Canyon is a catch you won't soon forget.","date":"13 May 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240513_NamibiaCanyon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a351f29d3feb110ac12b5e835ffc4870","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NamibiaCanyon_ROW0680691554_tmb.jpg","title":"Fish River Canyon, Namibia","desc":"Whether it's the world's oldest desert, the Namib or the Quiver Tree Forest, Namibia in Southern Africa is home to some truly great tourist…","hash":"hTmtmfFLhcsf5Wgela7K0f0963mZDJnXphXIBsC4OIw="}},{"startdate":"20240512","fullstartdate":"202405120700","enddate":"20240513","url":"/th?id=OHR.GuanacoMother_ROW9953050710_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.GuanacoMother_ROW9953050710","copyright":"Guanaco female and newborn baby in grassland, La Pampa Province, Argentina (© Gabriel Rojo/Minden Pictures)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Guanaco&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240512_0700%22","title":"Info","caption":"Guanaco mother and baby","copyrightonly":"© Gabriel Rojo/Minden Pictures","desc":"In today's image, we see a guanaco mother and baby. These members of the camel family are related to other lamoids such as the vicuña, alpaca and llama, and spend their days roaming the vast grasslands of La Pampa, Argentina. Just like a human mom, a guanaco female is fiercely protective of her child, also known as 'chulengo.' They give birth to chulengos, who are born after a gestation period of about 11 months. At birth, chulengos are precocial, meaning they are relatively mature and mobile, able to stand and walk shortly after they’re born. Adults stand around 110 centimetres tall, weighing approximately 90 kilograms. After a year of wandering along with the herd, the male guanaco is chased off by the dominant male of the herd. As we celebrate the natural beauty and significance of the guanaco, let us also recognise the importance of safeguarding their habitats and ensuring the continued conservation of this iconic species for future generations.","date":"12 May 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240512_GuanacoMother%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"739671a7f7658b2ebb03334f8d31fb37","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GuanacoMother_ROW9953050710_tmb.jpg","title":"Guanaco mother and baby","desc":"In today's image, we see a guanaco mother and baby.

Among these intrepid travellers is the indigo bunting, a tiny seed-eating songbird with plumage like the twilight sky. They travel thousands of kilometres using the stars to navigate. Typically found in North America, Central America and northern South America, these little creatures are around 11.5 - 15 centimetres long with a wingspan of between 18 - 23 centimetres. The indigo bunting's musical vocalisations, a delightful series of rapid, jumbled warbles, signal the onset of their breeding season in late April or May. During this time, male buntings establish territories and serenade potential mates with their enchanting songs. So, let's turn our gazes upward, where the pulse of life flaps with untiring wings and pledge to safeguard the flyways that are essential for ecological balance.","date":"11 May 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240511_TexasIndigoBunting%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"03bffb9dccfd891a226d366f6cb2894f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TexasIndigoBunting_ROW1066867513_tmb.jpg","title":"Indigo bunting","desc":"In the vast tapestry of nature's wonders, few sights are as awe-inspiring as the annual odysseys undertaken by our feathered friends.
