While the beach boasts turquoise waters, sandy shores and crashing waves, it's the shark-teeth-like rocks, standing as tall as 10 metres against the currents of the Indian Ocean, that truly steal the show. These rock formations have earned the area nicknames such as 'rock screen' and 'shark's teeth.' While this beach has no tourist accommodation, the nearby Kiluan Bay village presents a haven for visitors.
