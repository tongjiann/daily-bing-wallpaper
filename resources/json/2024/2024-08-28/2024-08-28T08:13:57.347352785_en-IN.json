Tread softly on Wolf Island, and you'll find the Nazca booby—a feathered bird endemic to this region. Despite their comical moniker derived from 'bobo,' Spanish for 'fool,' due to their land-bound awkwardness, these birds are graceful in flight and a marvel to behold. The Galápagos, much like India's very own Andaman and Nicobar Islands, boasts a unique tapestry of biodiversity.

At about 16 kilometres from Yellowstone National Park, these peaks, part of a mountain range less than 10 million years old, continue to captivate with their youthful defiance against erosion. Encompassing thriving ecosystems, the park is a sanctuary for grizzly bears, wolves and the flight of bald eagles. Like its peaks, many of the park's lakes, including the 24-kilometre-long Jackson Lake, were carved out by glaciers hundreds of thousands of years ago. Towering over the Jackson Hole valley and reflected in one of its many lakes, the Tetons and the park are a breathtaking sight to behold.","date":"Aug 20, 2024","bsTitle":"Where the deer and the antelope play","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240819_TetonSunrise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2368803e0e2b52a370c055b03110c68f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TetonSunrise_EN-IN0048035143_tmb.jpg","title":"Sunrise at Grand Teton National Park","desc":"Hey, wanderlust warriors, saddle up for an American adventure at Wyoming's very own outdoor marvel – the Grand Teton National Park!

Originally, lighthouses were powered by fires and oil lamps, requiring lighthouse keepers to maintain them. These days, however, most lighthouses have been automated and installed with electric light sources.

Over time, the focus of the celebration has shifted from solely nationalism to a broader appreciation of Indian culture and heritage. The Indian diaspora also celebrates this day worldwide, with parades and events, especially in areas with significant Indian populations.
