Many of the buildings, which are made of the same basalt that the town stands on, seem to teeter on the edge of the precipice.

Designed by architect Paul Abadie, the basilica's architecture is a blend of Neo-Byzantine-Romanesque style, which might remind you of a giant wedding cake—layered and ornate.

These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to 6 metres and weighing more than 450 kilograms. What sets them apart is their dark green colour, which helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes and seasonally flooded savannahs. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping their prey's populations under control. Fewer caimans mean more piranhas, which attack cattle, and more capybaras, which cause crop damage.","date":"27 Aug 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240827_YoungCaiman%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a112b29308b32d94851c67695dbca289","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YoungCaiman_ROW5014887226_tmb.jpg","title":"Young black caiman","desc":"Today's image features a black caiman, South America's stealthy river giant, in the Tambopata National Reserve, Peru.

Spanning approximately 4,100 square kilometres, this park protects animals such as grizzly bears, moose, elks and mountain goats. Glacier National Park also houses the Going-to-the-Sun Road, more than 1,120 kilometres of trails and the awe-inspiring vistas of Swiftcurrent Lake, seen in today's image.
