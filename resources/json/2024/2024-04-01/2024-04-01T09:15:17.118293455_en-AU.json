These towering behemoths are not just sky-dwellers; they are the architects of thunderstorms and severe weather conditions. A wanderer in the sky, on their collapse, they undergo a transformative two-stage journey downstream.

There are over 8,000 species of tree frogs, typically found in Central America, Europe and Australia. The American green tree frog is the official state amphibian of both Louisiana and Georgia.
