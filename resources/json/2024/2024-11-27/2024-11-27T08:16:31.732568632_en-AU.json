The Giant's Tomb, as the hill is known in English, resembles a giant resting in the crook of the 210-kilometre-long Semois River. The name originates from a local legend about a Gallic giant, Treviso, who chose to leap off the cliffs of Rocher des Gattes rather than be captured by Roman soldiers. This vantage point, popular among hikers and road-trippers, provides a view that shifts dramatically with the seasons. During autumn, the landscape dons warm colours, as seen in today's image, making it an ideal spot for nature enthusiasts and photographers.","date":"27 Nov 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241127_SemoisRiver%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"45b4494b5c652720202ffe1f8aeff2d6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SemoisRiver_ROW4510626707_tmb.jpg","title":"Tombeau du Géant in Bouillon, Belgium","desc":"Tombeau du Géant in Bouillon, Belgium, offers a picturesque panorama for those who make the journey to see it.
