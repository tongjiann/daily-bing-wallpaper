In the image, the turtle is gliding over staghorn coral, a threatened species of marine invertebrate. This coral can grow to over 1 metre and is crucial to marine ecosystems. Thanks to its rapid growth, it acts as a marine nursery for juvenile fish, as well as providing buffer zones against erosion and storms.","date":"28 Dec 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241228_CoralTurtle%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2b74611e80c1bb8944d5e8686b70cbdf","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CoralTurtle_ROW9351762717_tmb.jpg","title":"Green sea turtle, New Caledonia","desc":"Today's image shows a green sea turtle swimming in the waters off New Caledonia in the southwest Pacific Ocean.

This over 2-kilometre lake, surrounded by the snow-dusted Julian Alps, was formed over 14,000 years ago through glacial and tectonic activity. The first signs of settlement on Bled Island date back to the New Stone Age (10,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE). Additionally, archaeologists uncovered an Early Medieval graveyard here from the 9th century CE.
