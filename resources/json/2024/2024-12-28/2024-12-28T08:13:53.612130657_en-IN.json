Towering at an impressive 310 metres with a 30-metre width, it is among India's tallest waterfalls. Translating to 'Sea of Milk,' it is a spectacular four-tiered waterfall on the Mandovi River. Legend has it, a beautiful princess would take a bath here and then drink sweetened milk from a golden jug. One day she saw a handsome prince watching her. To protect her modesty, she poured the milk, forming a white curtain as a shield. According to the tale, the milk continues to flow down the mountains as a tribute to her grace and virtue. This gem in the Western Ghats marks the journey of the Mandovi River as it falls toward Panaji and finally meets the Arabian Sea. During the dry season, the falls might seem unassuming, but with the arrival of the monsoon, they transform into a magnificent cascade of thundering water.","date":"Dec 28, 2024","bsTitle":"Pouring wonders","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241227_DudhsagarFalls%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"541351c968f7b01278742d65930b2ad9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DudhsagarFalls_EN-IN8941732838_tmb.jpg","title":"Dudhsagar Falls, Goa","desc":"Today, let's explore the magic of Dudhsagar Falls in Goa.

Recognised as a state holiday in India, Christmas is celebrated as a secular occasion. For Christians, particularly Catholics, attending Midnight Mass is a key tradition. Many Christian households adorn their homes with cribs, trees and brightly lit stars symbolising the Bethlehem star. They also share sweets and cakes with neighbours.
