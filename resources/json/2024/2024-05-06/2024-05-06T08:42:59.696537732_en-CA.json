These hummingbirds are typically vibrant in colour, but leucism means that they have decreased pigmentation, resulting in a paler appearance. Unlike albino birds, these hummingbirds retain some colour in their eyes. Their lighter plumage reduces protective camouflage, making them more vulnerable to predators such as hawks and feral cats.

Despite their small size, Adélie penguins are sleek swimmers and can dive as deep as 175 metres in search of shrimp-like krill or fish. They are social animals which gather in small colonies for foraging, hunting and protection.
