Rising to a height of 505 metres, it stands above the town of Leek in Staffordshire. The Roaches, part of the Peak District National Park, is a popular destination for climbers and hikers. It offers stunning views over the moorland and, if you're lucky, you may even spot a wallaby! A number of these Australian marsupials escaped from a nearby private zoo in the 1930s, and there are still recorded sightings of the descendants of the original wallabies.","date":"May 6, 2024","bsTitle":"A peek into the Peak District","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240506_TheRoachesPeakDistrict%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"57b2ffe0c022b2c47f8a6f8a946657d1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TheRoachesPeakDistrict_EN-CA6826651517_tmb.jpg","title":"The Roaches ridge in the Peak District, England","desc":"In today's image, the sun encroaches on the Roaches, a rocky ridge in the Peak District, northern England.
