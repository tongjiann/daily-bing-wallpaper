Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters. His painting of the Last Judgement in Florence Cathedral and his illustrations of Dante's Inferno are replete with mythical beings.","date":"Oct 22, 2024","bsTitle":"Fearsome façade","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241021_MonsterDoor%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4ee4dc3f024514f876b7e62ae9b02b07","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MonsterDoor_EN-IN9699696476_tmb.jpg","title":"Palazzo Zuccari, Rome","desc":"At the top of the Spanish Steps in Rome, take a left underneath the imposing Catholic church.

Smith State Park, which spans 6.61 square kilometres in Emanuel County, Georgia. The park's centrepiece, seen in today's image, is a 1.6-square-kilometre mill pond, a favourite spot for fishing and canoeing. Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the US. Winding through the park are over 11 kilometres of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat. The hardwood trees here are a haven for woodpeckers and other birds, while the soft soil provides ideal burrowing ground for tortoises. No matter the season, this park promises a peaceful retreat for all.","date":"Oct 21, 2024","bsTitle":"Standing tall and proud","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241020_AutumnCypress%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"cd05aab5dfa46b2b79b6389101e05047","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AutumnCypress_EN-IN6952918183_tmb.jpg","title":"Cypress trees in George L.

Situated about 2.5 kilometres southeast of the modern-day town of Dendera, this temple complex is among the best preserved in the country. Once a thriving oasis along the Nile, it was home to thousands at its height, surrounded by a vast mudbrick wall that protected its sacred grounds. The Temple of Hathor, the crown jewel of Dendera, featured in today's image, immediately draws visitors' eyes. Its construction started around 54 BCE, under Ptolemy XII, with the majestic hypostyle hall added later during the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius. This temple doesn't have a grand colonnade or pylon gateway at its entrance. Instead, an unfinished stone wall surrounds an open courtyard with entrances leading to this massive hall. So, the complex you see today is truly a testament to centuries of history and evolution. Isn't it amazing how much history one place can hold?","date":"Oct 19, 2024","bsTitle":"Uncovering the past for the present","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241018_DenderaTemple%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b5904f503a732786fedb584401333d88","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DenderaTemple_EN-IN5970079053_tmb.jpg","title":"Temple of Hathor, Dendera Temple Complex, Qena, Egypt","desc":"Let's go on a journey to one of the most captivating spots in ancient Egypt—Dendera.
