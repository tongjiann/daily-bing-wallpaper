These limestone bridges, towering over a deep gorge, are named after three dragons: Tianlong (Sky Dragon), Qinglong (Azure Dragon) and Heilong (Black Dragon). Tianlong, standing at 235 metres, has a bridge-pier with maze-like caves in it. The Qinglong Bridge, which is 281 metres high, offers breathtaking views when the sun is out. Heilong Bridge is the widest of the three bridges at 193 metres and reaches a height of 223 metres. Visitors can explore the Wulong Karst National Geology Park and visit places like the Furong Cave, a 2,846-metre cave with huge limestone stalactites, which are mineral formations that hang from the ceiling. Standing beneath these magnificent natural bridges, you can't help but be humbled by the sheer power of time and nature.","date":"3 Aug 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240803_WulongKarst%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"392ca9423a9df3bf1f1d1f1e003e2387","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WulongKarst_ROW4842931095_tmb.jpg","title":"Three Natural Bridges, Wulong National Park, China","desc":"Carved by nature over centuries, the Three Natural Bridges in Wulong Karst, China, is a geological wonder.
