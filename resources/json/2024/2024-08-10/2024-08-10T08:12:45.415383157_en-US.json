Located where the Mojave and Colorado Deserts meet, it has been home to various cultures for thousands of years. Its earliest known residents were people from the Pinto Culture, who lived here from 8000 to 4000 BCE. Centuries later, this land was inhabited by the native Cahuilla, Serrano, and Chemehuevi peoples. The park's namesake, the Joshua tree, grows in a landscape covering 1,242 square miles. Despite their name, they are not really trees, but rather a kind of succulent. Native to southwest US and northern Mexico, they can grow up to 40 feet tall.","date":"Aug 10, 2024","bsTitle":"Joshua under a starry blanket","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240810_JoshuaTreeNP%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"23b1b28c4e7cf67089a35063f63dfbcd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JoshuaTreeNP_EN-US1399159741_tmb.jpg","title":"Joshua Tree National Park, California","desc":"California's Joshua Tree National Park has a history that began way before it was made a national monument on August 10, 1936.
