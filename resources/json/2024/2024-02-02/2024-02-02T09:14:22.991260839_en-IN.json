The Alpine marmot seen here today, has its own winter tradition of stocking up on food to prepare for a long hibernation. Primarily found in mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, these robust rodents have a stocky build, short legs and a blunt snout. They inhabit alpine meadows and rocky areas, preferring elevations between 1,200 to 3,200 metres. They feed on various vegetation, including grasses, herbs and flowers, along with insects, spiders and worms. Despite their current non-endangered status, the species is vulnerable, particularly in regions like the Jura Mountains and Germany where they are regularly hunted.","date":"Feb 2, 2024","bsTitle":"Looking right at you!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240201_AlpineMarmot%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"88e8fdec2aca544d94c244b719708239","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AlpineMarmot_EN-IN2558708163_tmb.jpg","title":"Alpine Marmot","desc":"Curious about how long this winter will last?
