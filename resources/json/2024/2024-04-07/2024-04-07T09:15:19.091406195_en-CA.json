Do you like your eggs boiled or painted? The practice of painting chicken eggs, which originates from Persian traditions, was adopted by Christians in the early 17th century to commemorate this holiday, also called Pascha. Hungarian artist, Tünde Csuhaj—living and working in the small city of southern Hungary, Szekszárd—has mastered the craft. The internationally recognised egg-painter developed her own etching technique to create lace-like patterns. The meticulous designs appear on all sorts of eggs, including chicken, goose, swan and even emu or ostrich eggs. The intricate motifs of incredible craftsmanship are often shown at national and international fairs and exhibitions. Are you inspired? Grab a paintbrush and test your egg-painting skills.","date":"Mar. 31, 2024","bsTitle":"Egg-cellent craftmanship","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240331_HungarianEggs%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"94315f794feb25c9a0ce86d21d258c2a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HungarianEggs_EN-CA7704543588_tmb.jpg","title":"Happy Easter!","desc":"Happy Easter!

Their large stomachs have four chambers, which can make up to 30% of their body weight when full. These shaggy critters are so sedentary that algae grow on their coats. This symbiotic relationship provides them with a greenish hue, offering effective camouflage within the rainforest canopy. In 2021, these slow-moving creatures were declared national symbols in Costa Rica.

When it was built, sperm whale oil was used to light the lamps; however, over the years, the mechanism has been upgraded to more advanced technology like LED bulbs and Fresnel lenses. Automated in 1984, the lighthouse continues to serve as a vital navigational aid, with its powerful beam shining up to 44 kilometres.

Revered for centuries by the Chinese, these fragile petals hold profound significance in their traditions, symbolising renewal, hope and the transient nature of life. There are various locations in China to view these blossoms, including Wuhan's East Lake Cherry Blossom Park, Shanghai's Gucun Park and Luxun Park, as well as Beijing's Yuyuantan Park.
