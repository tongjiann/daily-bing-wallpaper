It has a profound connection to St. Dwynwen, the patron saint of lovers, which can be seen in the name of the island: Llanddwyn means 'Church of Dwynwen.' Legend has it that Dwynwen, a princess in the 5th century, sought solace on this island after a tragic love story. The young woman fell in love with a commoner, but because her royal father forbade the union—and after briefly turning her beloved into a block of ice—she moved to the island and set up a convent. She dedicated her life to spirituality, living as a hermit and helping others with matters of the heart. The remains of Dwynwen's church, a well and the ruins of a convent are testaments to her legacy on Ynys Llanddwyn.","date":"25 Jan 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240125_DwynwensDay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"df823b494a7c4b6b3dfdbaf29266e0db","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DwynwensDay_ROW2715947734_tmb.jpg","title":"Ynys Llanddwyn, Wales, United Kingdom","desc":"Ynys Llanddwyn—or Llanddywn island—is a tiny, idyllic piece of land off the western coast of Anglesey in Wales, United Kingdom.

These barriers form pools, with thin, lacy waterfalls leading from one 'lake' to another.
