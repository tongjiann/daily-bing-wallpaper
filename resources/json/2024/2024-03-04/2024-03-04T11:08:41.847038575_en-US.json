Alongside its steep valleys and colorful rock formations, the canyon holds the stories of Native Americans, European, and American pioneers—the oldest human artifacts found here date back nearly 12,000 years. In addition to tourist adventures such as cruising on the Colorado River, joining the Trail of Time walking tour, or climbing up to the Desert View Watchtower, the park is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a registered International Dark Sky Park for crystal-clear stargazing.","date":"Feb 26, 2024","bsTitle":"Deeply chasm-matic","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240226_GrandCanyonWinter%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"53068a0f77aca1e1c1ad63fa39fd13b0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GrandCanyonWinter_EN-US3010552047_tmb.jpg","title":"Grand Canyon National Park turns 105","desc":"Happy birthday to Grand Canyon National Park!

For a couple of weeks in February, if skies are clear, water is flowing, and the sun shines at just the right angle, the long, slender waterfall takes on a glowing, flame-hued appearance. Hundreds gather in Yosemite Valley to see this mesmerizing natural spectacle. The phenomenon has earned the moniker 'firefall,' an homage to the historic Yosemite Firefall, a manmade event from the top of the park's Glacier Point that took place between 1872 to 1968.

In 1932, it was the stage for a 'mass trespass,' in which hundreds of people on foot protested for public access to these lands. At the time, many areas of open countryside were closed to the British public. This act of civil disobedience prompted much public sympathy, which eventually led to the establishment of the UK's first national parks.
