The Caribbean flamingo is the largest species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries and along coastlines.

Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Iceland, covers over 7,500 square kilometres—approximately 10% of the country's landmass. As the glaciers melt, the water carries fine sediments, creating a braided river system with a milky appearance that contrasts with the earthy tones of the volcanic terrain. Every spring and summer, the rivers swell with seasonal meltwater, continually shaping and reshaping the land. Aerial views reveal their intricate patterns, resembling complex artworks that interweave across the terrain toward the North Atlantic Ocean.

Its flow powers hydroelectric power stations, reinforcing Iceland's status as a leader in sustainable energy.","date":"Nov 8, 2024","bsTitle":"From the land of fire and ice","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241107_GlacialRivers%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ebde73b5f67b781d684924aec64c0bd1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GlacialRivers_EN-IN8184240040_tmb.jpg","title":"Glacial rivers, Iceland","desc":"Glacial rivers in 'the land of fire and ice'—Iceland—have shaped the landscape over thousands of years.
