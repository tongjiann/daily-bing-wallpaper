Later, wind and water carved out the arches, pinnacles, fins and balanced rocks that now stand in this area.

The Caribbean flamingo is the largest species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries and along coastlines.
