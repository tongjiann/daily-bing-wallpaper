Here, visitors are greeted by old cottages and homes built from local bluish-green slate. Dove Cottage, Wordsworth's humble abode from 1799 to 1808, and the adjacent museum offer a dive into the poet's life. His later residence, Rydal Mount, continues the story just a short journey away. The heart of the village is St. Oswald's Church, which dates to the 13th century and is Wordsworth's final resting place. Not far from the church, the aroma of the renowned Grasmere Gingerbread, made from a secret recipe, will set visitors' mouths watering.","date":"Nov 4, 2024","bsTitle":"Worth a thousand words","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241104_CumbriaAutumn%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7ba338b4b4ce2ee1636a1b8a5af599ae","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CumbriaAutumn_EN-US4102686749_tmb.jpg","title":"Grasmere, Lake District, Cumbria, England","desc":"A place where poetry, history, and nature blend—welcome to Grasmere in England's Lake District.

Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers, and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park, featured in today's image.
