This wonderland has towering castles, lanterns and intricate sculptures, all made of ice. In 2007, 'Romantic Feelings,' the world's largest snow sculpture at 35 metres in height, was created here in the shape of an Olympic-themed artwork.

The bridge was painted International Orange—the golden adjective refers to the sun-reflecting waters below—and was opened to the public in 1937. It wasn't an easy vision to accomplish, especially as it was built during the Great Depression.
