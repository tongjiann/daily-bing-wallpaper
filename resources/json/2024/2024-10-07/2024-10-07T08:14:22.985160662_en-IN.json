A centrepiece of the new Hafencity development, it's Hamburg's tallest inhabited building—there are 45 luxury apartments on the upper floors—reaching a height of 107 metres. The Elbphilharmonie features three concert venues: the Great Concert Hall, with vineyard-style seating for 2,100, and acoustics designed by renowned Japanese acoustician Yasuhisa Toyota; the Recital Hall, accommodating 550 for recitals, chamber music and jazz; and the Kaistudio, a 170-seat space for educational activities.
