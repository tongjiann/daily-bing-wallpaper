Flamingos are referred to as a flamboyance when in a group, but they can also be called a stand, colony, or pat. The Caribbean flamingo is the largest flamingo species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries, and along coastlines. Because of their pink color, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills. However, their long necks and bent bills distinguish them from other wading birds like the great blue heron and wood stork.","date":"Nov 10, 2024","bsTitle":"Flamboyance in flight","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241110_YucatanFlamingos%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f4582ab5feca2af29cd8a960b867d35d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YucatanFlamingos_EN-US4470232432_tmb.jpg","title":"Caribbean flamingos, Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico","desc":"Ever seen a group of flamingos take to the skies?

Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Iceland, covers over 3,000 square miles—approximately 10% of the country's landmass. As the glaciers melt, the water carries fine sediments, creating a braided river system with a milky appearance that contrasts with the earthy tones of the volcanic terrain. Every spring and summer, the rivers swell with seasonal meltwater, continually shaping and reshaping the land. Aerial views reveal their intricate patterns, interwoven across the terrain toward the North Atlantic Ocean. The water also powers hydroelectric power stations, reinforcing Iceland's status as a leader in sustainable energy.","date":"Nov 8, 2024","bsTitle":"From the land of fire and ice","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241108_GlacialRivers%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fe194686369d4960722b11db15c619fa","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GlacialRivers_EN-US4356459123_tmb.jpg","title":"Glacial rivers in Iceland","desc":"Iceland's glacial rivers have shaped the landscape here in the land of fire and ice over thousands of years.
