The city's history can be traced back to the 12th century when it was a fishing village on the banks of the Amstel River. Institutions like the Van Gogh Museum, the Eye Film Museum, and the National Maritime Museum offer insights into its history and arts legacy. Amsterdam's canal ring area, built at the turn of the 17th century, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city is also home to its fair share of restaurants, vintage shops, and outdoor markets in neighborhoods like Oud-West, pictured in today's image. Get ready to pedal because Amsterdam's cycling culture is ubiquitous. With approximately 320 miles of bike lanes, it's one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world.","date":"Dec 29, 2023","bsTitle":"Oud-West side story","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20231229_BlueAmsterdam%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"400bef3980f3637507f7f8cc5f87c627","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BlueAmsterdam_EN-US6868017848_tmb.jpg","title":"Oud-West, Amsterdam, Netherlands","desc":"Welcome to Amsterdam!

With two layers of fur and eyes that adapt to the Arctic's shifting light levels, reindeer are very versatile. You likely won't see them fly, but you might find a herd migrating from tundra to forest in the North Polar Region, North America, Northern Europe, or Siberia. Their hooves can expand or shrink according to ground conditions, keeping their heavy frame stable on soft ground in summer, ice in winter, and steep rooftops at Christmas.
