Seen in the image today is the Teatro Colón, Buenos Aires, a symbol of Argentina's rich theatrical heritage. Built in 1908, the theatre is renowned for its grand architecture and exceptional acoustics, making it one of the world's premier opera houses. Over the years, it has hosted performances by legendary figures such as Enrico Caruso, Richard Strauss, Lily Pons, Marina de Gabaráin, Joss Stone, Branford Marsalis and many more.

One origin of the name 'Hang Rai' or 'Rai Cave' comes from otters (rai) that were occasionally seen seeking shelter in the cave. Another explanation is attributed to the abundance of rai trees in the area, whose oil was used to waterproof boats.
