Over the course of the festivities, thousands of people take to the streets in elaborate costumes that imitate traditional 17th-century Venetian clothes. There are parades, parties and processions galore during the carnival, along with concerts and street performances, all of which last until Shrove Tuesday, which falls on February 13 this year.

Once the prediction is made, it is read to the crowd, who cheer Willie on either way. The original Willie passed away in 1999, and since then, the celebration has been held with a successor to the original Willie.
