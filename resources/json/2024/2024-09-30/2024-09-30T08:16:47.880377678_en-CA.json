The otter featured in today's image was photographed in Prince William Sound, Alaska, United States. Sea otters are native to the northern and eastern coasts of the North Pacific Ocean. Weighing 14 to 45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized.","date":"Sep. 23, 2024","bsTitle":"Otter-ly amazing","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240923_IcebergOtter%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"95eecffe1c464cae97364622f3cf9947","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.IcebergOtter_EN-CA0060532970_tmb.jpg","title":"Sea Otter Awareness Week","desc":"This week is Sea Otter Awareness Week, an event that draws attention to these fluffy floating mammals.

During a racquetball game, one of them exclaimed 'Aaarrr!' in response to an injury, and the concept of a day dedicated to pirate lingo was born. Initially an inside joke, Talk Like a Pirate Day gained popularity after the duo shared the idea with humourist Dave Barry in 2002, who promoted it in his syndicated column. Since then, it's become a day of fun and parodic celebration—people don pirate costumes, engage in pirate-themed activities, like the kid on the ship in today's image, and embrace mock pirate language. Whether ye be a seasoned buccaneer or a greenhorn, today be for all to enjoy.

Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease.","date":"Sep. 16, 2024","bsTitle":"Hoppily ever after","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240916_SunriseWallabies%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"765a701c9d9c293e9a2bff26a1c3dd88","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SunriseWallabies_EN-CA0408938056_tmb.jpg","title":"Wallabies at sunrise, Australia","desc":"Amid the hues of dawn, captured in today's image, two wallabies stand alert in a field near the Adelaide River in Australia.
