The most populous city in Canada and the capital of Ontario, it boasts a population of 2,794,356 as of 2021, making it the fourth-largest city in North America. Known for its dynamic blend of business, finance, arts, sports and culture, the city is also celebrated for its multicultural and cosmopolitan character. Indigenous peoples have inhabited this region for more than 10,000 years. Following the contentious Toronto Purchase, the British established York in 1793, which was later renamed Toronto and incorporated as a city in 1834. Geographically, Lake Ontario is the smallest of the Great Lakes in surface area, spanning 19,010 square kilometres, yet it surpasses Lake Erie in volume. It's the 13th largest lake globally, with a shoreline of 1,145 kilometres.","date":"5 Sep 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240905_TIFF2024%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"256b99c193539ab612df80a58ad7a0b8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TIFF2024_ROW8059887300_tmb.jpg","title":"Toronto, Canada","desc":"Today's image features Toronto's skyline overlooking Lake Ontario, Canada.
