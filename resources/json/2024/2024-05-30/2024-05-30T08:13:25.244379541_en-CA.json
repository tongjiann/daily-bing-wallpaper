This park in Florida encapsulates the largest subtropical wilderness of the United States. The Everglades, spanning more than 6,100 square kilometres, is a lifeline to 36 federally protected and endangered wildlife, from the gentle manatee to the stealthy Florida panther. Here, the air thrums with the calls of over 350 bird species like limpkins and snail kites, while the waters teem with life too: fish, like snook and redfish and American crocodiles are all found here. Beyond its biodiversity, the park has earned global recognition, celebrated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve and a Wetland of International Importance. So, here's to Everglades National Park—may it continue to inspire wonder, curiosity and appreciation for the wild world around us.","date":"May 30, 2024","bsTitle":"'Everglad' to be here","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240530_Everglades90th%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fd4a269c186c74f65ac97da36dbbfd8a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Everglades90th_EN-CA7240904105_tmb.jpg","title":"Everglades National Park, Florida","desc":"On this day, 90 years ago, an act was passed that would lead to the creation of one of America's natural gems: The Everglades National Park…","hash":"toGBvASsLC4b8dnhpyqs2ZDfMGlubWNRJA5vPm8Odoo="}},{"startdate":"20240529","fullstartdate":"202405290400","enddate":"20240530","url":"/th?id=OHR.MullOtter_EN-CA6618769900_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.MullOtter_EN-CA6618769900","copyright":"Adolescent European otters, Loch Spelve, Isle of Mull, Scotland (© Neil Henderson/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=World+Otter+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240529_0400%22","title":"'Otter' you looking at?","caption":"World Otter Day","copyrightonly":"© Neil Henderson/Alamy","desc":"Playful, strong swimmers and expert hunters—meet the otters.

These flowers also play crucial roles in the valley's ecosystem. Lupines are nitrogen-fixing plants; they help improve soil fertility by converting atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be used by neighbouring plants. Balsamroot, on the other hand, attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies, which helps in plant reproduction and, in turn, contributes to the biodiversity of the region.
