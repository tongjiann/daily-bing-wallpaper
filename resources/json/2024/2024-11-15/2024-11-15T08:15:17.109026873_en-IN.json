The rivers seen in today's image are formed from the meltwater of vast glaciers like Vatnajökull, Langjökull and Hofsjökull. Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Iceland, covers over 7,500 square kilometres—approximately 10% of the country's landmass. As the glaciers melt, the water carries fine sediments, creating a braided river system with a milky appearance that contrasts with the earthy tones of the volcanic terrain. Every spring and summer, the rivers swell with seasonal meltwater, continually shaping and reshaping the land. Aerial views reveal their intricate patterns, resembling complex artworks that interweave across the terrain toward the North Atlantic Ocean. The water in Iceland is more than just a beautiful sight; it plays a significant role in renewable energy. Its flow powers hydroelectric power stations, reinforcing Iceland's status as a leader in sustainable energy.","date":"Nov 8, 2024","bsTitle":"From the land of fire and ice","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241107_GlacialRivers%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ebde73b5f67b781d684924aec64c0bd1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GlacialRivers_EN-IN8184240040_tmb.jpg","title":"Glacial rivers, Iceland","desc":"Glacial rivers in 'the land of fire and ice'—Iceland—have shaped the landscape over thousands of years.

Their diet primarily consists of fish, clams, mussels, crabs, otters and seals. This marine-based diet is a major difference with other wolf species, which feed almost exclusively on meat.
