Today's image features a pair of tigers in Jim Corbett National Park in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. It was established in 1936 as Hailey National Park and covers approximately 320 square kilometres. It was later renamed Corbett National Park in honour of Jim Corbett, a conservationist who played a crucial role in its creation. The park was the first to be included in Project Tiger, India's initiative to protect endangered tigers. This park has 256 Bengal tigers, master predators that play an essential role in the park's ecosystem. Did you know that seventy percent of the global population of tigers—over 3,600—lives in India? These majestic predators are at the top of the food chain, often hunting large animals like water buffalo and even small elephants. Here visitors can book a jungle safari, accompanied by forest rangers.","date":"29 Jul 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240729_CorbettTigers%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"27d399890aa0e5f9a579ab79b9fe6959","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CorbettTigers_ROW3333528586_tmb.jpg","title":"Tigers in Uttarakhand, India","desc":"We're off to a roaring start!

Back then hammocks were made from the bark of trees, whereas now they can be made of various materials like cotton, nylon and canvas. They come in different shapes and sizes, like Nicaraguan hammocks, which are usually made of woven material with a wooden spreader bar. These sleeping swings have sailed across oceans as sailor beds, swung from the trees as forest dwellers' bedrooms, and nowadays, add a touch of chill to hip outdoor retreats.
