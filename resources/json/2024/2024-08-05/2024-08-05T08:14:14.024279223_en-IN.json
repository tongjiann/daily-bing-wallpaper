The most iconic of them is Thor's Hammer, a hoodoo that overlooks a part of the park known as the 'Silent City.' The Queen's Garden Trail, which leads from Sunset Point to Sunrise Point, offers even more vistas and rock formations, including the Queen Victoria hoodoo. According to the legend told by the Paiute indigenous people who inhabited this area, hoodoos are people who have been turned to stone for their misdeeds by the trickster Coyote.
