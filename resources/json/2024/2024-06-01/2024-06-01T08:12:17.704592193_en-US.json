Come to Aït Benhaddou, Morocco, on the old caravan route linking the Sahara to Marrakesh. This UNESCO World Heritage Site showcases Moroccan earthen clay architecture, made using sun-dried mud. Although none of the buildings here are believed to predate the 17th century, they are constructed using techniques and styles that are much older. Located on the gentle slopes overlooking the Asif Ounila (Ounila River) the Ksar of Aït Benhaddou is a fortified village, clustered within a defensive wall with corner towers. The ksar's communal landscape includes a public square, a mosque, grain-threshing areas beyond the fortifications, and a caravanserai—a type of roadside inn, among other features. So, if you are seeking a journey off the beaten path, Aït Benhaddou awaits you.","date":"May 25, 2024","bsTitle":"Guardians of the dunes","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240525_MoroccoBenhaddou%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9041e06b96a0de5a48e7da520d52eb95","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MoroccoBenhaddou_EN-US4848616753_tmb.jpg","title":"Aït Benhaddou, Morocco","desc":"Are you looking for sandy charms?

May 22 was named International Day for Biological Diversity by the United Nations in 2000. Unfortunately, the biodiversity of Earth is slowly decreasing due to climate change, the draining of natural resources, urbanization, and pollution, among other factors.

One of the best-known monuments in the area is the medieval Doria Castle, built as a defensive fortress to protect the village from frequent pirate attacks. Thanks to the construction of the Genoa–La Spezia rail line in the 19th century, the village became more accessible by land. The car-free cobblestone streets are ideal for walking around. While here, you might want to visit the Chapel of Santa Marta and the Sanctuary of Madonna di Reggio.
