Shaped over time by the Tasman Sea, it was once the roof of a massive sea cave. The sea's pressure, combined with air, sand, and stones, slowly pried open the vertical cracks in the cliff, dislodging chunks of rock. The cave kept growing, deepening, and lengthening, until it eventually gave way, leaving behind this towering natural bridge. Tasmans Arch is named after the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who also lends his name to the state of Tasmania.","date":"Nov 19, 2024","bsTitle":"An arch that rocks","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241119_TasmansArch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8c943c90dfa9d7139022b989fd564b0a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TasmansArch_EN-US4274981499_tmb.jpg","title":"Tasmans Arch, Tasmania, Australia","desc":"Ready for a coastal adventure?
