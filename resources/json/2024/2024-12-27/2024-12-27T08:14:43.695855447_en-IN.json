Set on Christmas Eve, it follows a young girl named Clara, who goes on an adventure with the Nutcracker Prince as they battle the evil Mouse King. Many renowned ballet companies present their rendition of this classic every year, including the New York City Ballet, the Boston Ballet and the English National Ballet, pictured here.

The village's waterfront is lined with the traditional fishermen's cabins called rorbu or rorbuer, which are mostly red in colour, as seen in today's image. Once important to fishermen, these cabins have now become a popular pick for tourist rentals. In 1999, German painter Ingo Kühl set up a pop-up studio in a rorbu in Reine, where he painted scenes of the harbour framed by the towering mountain range.
