In the early hours of June 28, 1969, New York City Police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village. At the time, homosexuality was illegal, and such raids were common. However, that night, the patrons of the Stonewall Inn, fed up with the continued harassment, stood their ground. Violence escalated, leading to clashes between protesters and police. In the following days, there was more rioting as people gathered to protest the raids.","date":"Jun 28, 2024","bsTitle":"The pride of New York City","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240628_ChristopherPark%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"f8f2fcd59488d2516cb05dd9f4ed8d53","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ChristopherPark_EN-US9362447266_tmb.jpg","title":"Pride 2024","desc":"Fifty-five years ago today, an act of resistance marked a turning point in the fight for LGBTQIA+ rights.

Built over an older cathedral, construction began in 1296 under the supervision of architect Arnolfo di Cambio. Italian architect Filippo Brunelleschi engineered its dome, the largest brick dome ever constructed. Its completion in 1436 was the final stage of the cathedral's construction. It's not just the outside that dazzles; inside there are artistic treasures to discover, from Giorgio Vasari's fresco 'The Last Judgment' to Paolo Uccello's intricate clock face. The cathedral complex is also home to the Baptistery, a small basilica, and Giotto's Campanile, a free-standing bell tower.","date":"Jun 27, 2024","bsTitle":"Dome sweet dome","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240627_FlorenceDuomo%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3822332af353b06dae3d772a23eef296","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FlorenceDuomo_EN-US1448955167_tmb.jpg","title":"Duomo Santa Maria del Fiore, Florence","desc":"Welcome to Florence, the cradle of the Renaissance.
