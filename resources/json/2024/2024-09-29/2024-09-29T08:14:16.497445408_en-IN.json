Known for their egalitarian and informal nature, Bavarians are famously sociable, a trait that's on full display during the annual Oktoberfest, the world's largest beer festival, attracting about six million visitors each year.

These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming.
