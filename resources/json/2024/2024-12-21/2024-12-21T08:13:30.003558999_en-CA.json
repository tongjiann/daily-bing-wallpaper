This has been an important event for millennia, with evidence of celebrations going back as far as 10,000 BCE. Some of the world's most famous Stone Age monuments, including Stonehenge, are aligned with the point that the sun rises or sets on the winter solstice. Traditionally, it was a time for feasting and lighting of fires to symbolise the darkest day of the year. Ancient Germanic tribes celebrated the winter solstice by bringing evergreens into their homes as a symbol of the returning light and the coming spring.","date":"Dec. 21, 2024","bsTitle":"Midwinter wonderland","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241221_SolsticeHalo%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"cce3b163867ca5b1c2f37cc947cc3829","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SolsticeHalo_EN-CA3461734834_tmb.jpg","title":"Happy winter solstice!","desc":"The winter solstice is here.

Founded by ornithologist Frank Chapman as an eco-friendly twist on holiday hunting parties, this annual event replaced shotguns with binoculars. Since then, it has become one of the world's longest-running citizen science projects. Every year from December 14 to January 5, volunteers of all ages and birding skill levels come together to survey designated areas called 'circles.' Each circle has a diameter of approximately 24 kilometres, and participants count every bird they see or hear within it. The result is a colossal snapshot of bird diversity, with data collected from over 2,500 locations each season. It's a serious effort to track changes in bird populations, providing valuable data for scientists working to protect vulnerable species.","date":"Dec. 14, 2024","bsTitle":"'Hoo' said that?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241214_NorthernHawkOwl%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e4b17dc302173e9b282fce22e8fe7d0d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NorthernHawkOwl_EN-CA1011187644_tmb.jpg","title":"Christmas Bird Count turns 125","desc":"For 125 years, bird enthusiasts across North America have turned the holiday season into a festive, feathered affair with the Christmas Bird…","hash":"erwdb2da0MOGa6QSGuDtBGKR9SJzAZA7kzg8rMHqKvw="}}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
