Invented by the Indigenous peoples of Central and South America, hammocks were called 'Hamacas' and were originally woven for sleep and relaxation. Back then hammocks were made from the bark of trees, whereas now they can be made of various materials like cotton, nylon and canvas. They come in different shapes and sizes, like Nicaraguan hammocks, which are usually made of woven material with a wooden spreader bar. These sleeping swings have sailed across oceans as sailor beds, swung from the trees as forest dwellers' bedrooms and nowadays, add a touch of chill to hip outdoor retreats. They have health benefits, too; gentle rocking can improve your sleep and even relieve stress.
