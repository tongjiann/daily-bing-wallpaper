These trees can grow to over 30 metres and usually have a pyramid-like shape when they're young. In today's image, we're transported to the George L. Smith State Park, which spans 661 hectares in Emanuel County in Georgia, United States. The park's centrepiece, seen in today's image, is the 160-hectare mill pond, a favourite spot for fishing and canoeing. Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the US. Winding through the park are over 11 kilometres of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat. The hardwood trees here are a haven for woodpeckers and other birds, while the soft soil provides ideal burrowing ground for tortoises. No matter the season, this park promises a peaceful retreat for all.","date":"21 Oct 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241021_AutumnCypress%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"06bfc7c2979bb443d791e0bdd909b9f1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AutumnCypress_ROW2544482735_tmb.jpg","title":"Cypress trees in George L.

The three-toed sloth, a laid-back, tree-loving mammal that's right at home in the tropical regions of South and Central America. They have short tails and three clawed toes on each limb, which help them cling onto branches with ease. Sloths are mainly leaf eaters, although they also snack on fruits, and tree sap to keep them going. To help them break down those tough, fibrous leaves, they have a special multi-chambered stomach. With their super slow metabolism, digestion takes its sweet time, and they don't need much food each day to get by. It's not just their stomachs that move at a leisurely pace; they're so slow-moving that algae often develop on their fur, giving a greenish tint, which handily also provides them camouflage.","date":"20 Oct 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241020_SmilingSloth%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"da581e835d78a4a1182e0f6b58adc360","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SmilingSloth_ROW2407860543_tmb.jpg","title":"Three-toed sloth in Costa Rica","desc":"The world's slowest mammal takes the spotlight in today's image.
