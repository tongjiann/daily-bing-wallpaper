Some migrations are truly astounding. The bar-tailed godwit embarks on an 11,000-kilometre nonstop flight across the Pacific from Alaska to New Zealand. The tiny ruby-throated hummingbird, weighing less than a nickel, makes the trip across the Gulf of Mexico—a seemingly impossible feat for its size. Migratory birds navigate the globe, instinctively knowing when and where to move to exploit seasonal abundance. The Arctic tern outshines them all with its intercontinental journey from pole to pole, covering 30,000 kilometres. Their migration routes are passages created based on environmental cues.","date":"Oct. 12, 2024","bsTitle":"Winging it across continents","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241012_QuebecDuck%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"230852c8234ca380143c1d143b6a3ea7","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.QuebecDuck_EN-CA0208524250_tmb.jpg","title":"World Migratory Bird Day","desc":"Celebrate our travelling feathered friends on World Migratory Bird Day!

Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells or man-made objects like bottles and cans.","date":"Oct. 8, 2024","bsTitle":"Ocean's eight","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241008_MototiOctopus%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fe274d0782cf8f88fe2d3d82f349bc5e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MototiOctopus_EN-CA0168451476_tmb.jpg","title":"World Octopus Day","desc":"Today, we celebrate a creature with three hearts and the uncanny ability to change colour at will: the octopus.
