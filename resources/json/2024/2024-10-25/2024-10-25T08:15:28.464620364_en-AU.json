Mont Blanc, seen in this image, is the highest mountain in Western Europe at 4,808.72 metres. This mountain keeps its summit snow-covered year-round. It has been a rite of passage for mountaineers since the first recorded ascent in 1786. If scaling the peak isn't your thing, don't worry—the Aiguille du Midi cable car takes you up to 3,842 metres, almost to the top. While skiing and snowboarding on Mont Blanc's slopes is the go-to in winter, summer turns the area into a hiking and trail-running haven.","date":"25 Oct 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241025_MontBlancMassif%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"55327cb9a31ffa1ef85b8dcd08ca78e9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MontBlancMassif_ROW3509551140_tmb.jpg","title":"Mont Blanc in Chamonix, France","desc":"Picture yourself at the highest peak in the Alps, where the air is crisp and the views are breathtaking.

When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled and by 1915, the place was abandoned.

Winding through the park are over 11 kilometres of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat.

The three-toed sloth, a laid-back, tree-loving mammal that's right at home in the tropical regions of South and Central America. They have short tails and three clawed toes on each limb, which help them cling onto branches with ease. Sloths are mainly leaf eaters, although they also snack on fruits, and tree sap to keep them going. To help them break down those tough, fibrous leaves, they have a special multi-chambered stomach. With their super slow metabolism, digestion takes its sweet time, and they don't need much food each day to get by. It's not just their stomachs that move at a leisurely pace; they're so slow-moving that algae often develop on their fur, giving a greenish tint, which handily also provides them camouflage.","date":"20 Oct 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241020_SmilingSloth%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"da581e835d78a4a1182e0f6b58adc360","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SmilingSloth_ROW2407860543_tmb.jpg","title":"Three-toed sloth in Costa Rica","desc":"The world's slowest mammal takes the spotlight in today's image.
