Trees sense the coming of winter not only by temperature, but by the angle at which sunlight hits their leaves. Because of New York's buildings, the unique interaction of light, shadows, and temperatures often results in fall foliage occurring later in the park than the rest of the city.","date":"Oct 18, 2024","bsTitle":"Falling for Central Park","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241018_CentralParkAutumn%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"499af36a77b78d3c31c9ffe7586ee1b2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CentralParkAutumn_EN-US2354288950_tmb.jpg","title":"Autumn in Central Park, New York","desc":"Every autumn, many of the 18,000 trees in Central Park, New York, are painted in shades of yellow, red, and orange.
