It's one of Central Park's most photographed seasons and autumn in the park has provided iconic backdrops for movies like 'When Harry Met Sally…' and 'Hair.' Trees sense the coming of winter not only by temperature, but by the angle at which light from sunrises and sunsets hits their leaves. Because of New York's buildings, the unique interaction of light, shadows and temperatures often results in fall foliage occurring later in the park than the rest of the city.","date":"Oct 18, 2024","bsTitle":"Fall in the Mall","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241017_CentralParkAutumn%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"81df97dc04bddb1df9b2a2886134d0f1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CentralParkAutumn_EN-IN5680267984_tmb.jpg","title":"Autumn in Central Park, New York, United States","desc":"Every autumn, many of the 18,000 trees in Central Park in New York, United States, are painted in shades of yellow, red and orange.
