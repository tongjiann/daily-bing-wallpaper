Established in 1995, this sanctuary has become a haven for these gentle giants, distinguished by their vividly tessellated coats, and polygonal-shaped spots that extend onto the lower legs, tail and face. Unfortunately, only around 16,000 reticulated giraffes remain in the wild, less than half of the approximately 36,000 recorded in the 1980s. Nevertheless, recent years have observed a promising trend in northern Kenya, where populations are rebounding thanks to places like the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy.

Although some consider lupine to be an invasive species that threatens native plants, its arrival is welcomed by locals and tourists as a cherished characteristic of the summer landscape. You can find lupine fields in various regions, including Reykjavík and near the Skógafoss waterfall.
