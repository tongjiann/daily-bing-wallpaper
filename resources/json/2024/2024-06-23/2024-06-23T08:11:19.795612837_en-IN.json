Female red foxes need to stay in their dens with their young after giving birth, so males spend their time going out to bring her food.

The ground floor of the current lighthouse served as a post office during the summer months until 2009, when Canada Post shut down the service, citing mould growth as a hazard.

They can survive in extremely dry conditions and can go without water for weeks, getting moisture from the food they eat. Moreover, gemsboks are adept runners, achieving speeds of up to 59 kilometres per hour. Their distinguishing trait is their notably elongated, straight horns. Although both genders possess these formidable defences, the females' horns tend to be slightly longer and sleeker while the males' horns are thicker with broader bases.
