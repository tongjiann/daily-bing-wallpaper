Lying on a narrow strip of land between two lochs, the site initially comprised 60 stones, although today only 36 remain. The exact purpose of the structure is still unknown; in 2008, an excavation project called the Ring of Brodgar Excavation was undertaken to try to learn more about the site, but the project has not yet reached any conclusive results. In 1999, the Heart of Neolithic Orkney, which includes the Ring of Brodgar, was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
