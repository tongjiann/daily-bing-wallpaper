Meerkats are highly social animals, living in tight-knit groups called mobs, which can consist of up to 30 individuals. These groups are a cooperative effort, with meerkats foraging together, grooming each other, babysitting and taking turns as sentinels to watch for predators. These critters create extensive burrows where they spend the night and retreat to escape the midday heat–meerkats love their afternoon siesta.","date":"3 Jul 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240703_MeerkatManor%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"398f46a2f4ec9c471e85bc47bc720611","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MeerkatManor_ROW4817737201_tmb.jpg","title":"Meerkat family","desc":"Everybody say, 'Hakuna Matata.'
