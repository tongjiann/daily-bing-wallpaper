It is estimated that we hit 8 billion people in November 2022 and the UN expects the world to reach 9.7 billion people in 2050. But not everywhere faces the same challenges. While some areas struggle with overcrowding, others grapple with decreasing populations. The Italian town of Gangi, Sicily, seen in today's image, had about 16,000 residents in the 1950s. Today, it is home to little more than 6,000. Keen on revitalization, Gangi attracts new residents by giving away abandoned houses, on the condition that the properties are then restored.","date":"Jul 11, 2024","bsTitle":"You are one in 8.1 billion","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240711_GangiSicily%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"11471886e111997b3d1e04343aa678a4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GangiSicily_EN-US5325083744_tmb.jpg","title":"World Population Day","desc":"In 1987, sometime around July 11, the world population reached the 5-billion mark.

Gracing the forests from Mexico through Costa Rica, where today's image was taken, to Colombia and Venezuela, this toucan gets its name from the red marking on the back of the neck. These birds circle through the air in groups of up to 15, and at night, snuggle together in tree cavities. Their song is as unique as their look—a high squeaky note that sounds like 'seek,' sometimes a 'purr' or even a raspy 'grhhrr.' Although deforestation and hunting pose threats to these birds, they are not endangered. For now, collared aracaris remain a captivating sight, a splash of color, and a burst of life amid the sprawling branches.","date":"Jul 10, 2024","bsTitle":"A 'toucan' of appreciation","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240710_CollaredAracari%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e0ad537322b0033acb719664a128ec1f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CollaredAracari_EN-US4924599176_tmb.jpg","title":"Collared aracari in Costa Rica","desc":"Black and yellow plumage, bright eyes, and an oversized bill—meet the collared aracari, a fascinating tropical bird.
