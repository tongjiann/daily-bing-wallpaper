An environmentally friendly form of transportation that is fun, good for your health, affordable, simple and durable. Once you learn to ride, you'll never forget how to wheel around. Karl von Drais, a German inventor, is credited with developing the first two-wheeler, the 'swiftwalker,' in 1817. The machine certainly needed some further thinking, since the wooden frame and wheels didn't have pedals. Pedals attached to the front wheel were first introduced in the early 1860s in Paris, and the name velocipede was soon replaced by bicycle. The modern versions of bikes were developed in the late 1800s, but the materials used for them are still constantly evolving to make the ride easier and more secure. So, hop on a bike to find your crew!","date":"3 Jun 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240603_CopenhagenBicycles%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"74dacbd157263cf80f0c14cb5c89fc87","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CopenhagenBicycles_ROW7187318932_tmb.jpg","title":"Bicycles in Copenhagen, Denmark","desc":"Bicycles are the best!
