Lupines, with their characteristic spiky blooms in purple, blue and white, and balsamroot, with its large, golden-yellow flowers, create a picturesque contrast with the rugged mountain backdrop. These flowers also play crucial roles in the valley's ecosystem. Lupines are nitrogen-fixing plants; they help improve soil fertility by converting atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be used by neighbouring plants. Balsamroot, on the other hand, attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies, which helps in plant reproduction and, in turn, contributes to the biodiversity of the region. Whether you're a seasoned botanist or nature enthusiast, the wildflowers of the Methow Valley will surely leave a lasting impression of the enchanting wilderness.","date":"May 26, 2024","bsTitle":"Wild and free","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240525_MethowWildflowers%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"82131b901878f7c763e745edda7bc013","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MethowWildflowers_EN-IN4970374222_tmb.jpg","title":"Methow Valley, North Cascades, Washington, USA","desc":"If you're looking for meadows blanketed with vibrant beds of wildflowers, the Methow Valley in the North Cascade Mountains, Washington, US…","hash":"hnjkRg+fYIb5N2wR2UblA69wt/jhvUp/NIDURMI7erM="}},{"startdate":"20240524","fullstartdate":"202405241830","enddate":"20240525","url":"/th?id=OHR.MoroccoBenhaddou_EN-IN4913242303_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.MoroccoBenhaddou_EN-IN4913242303","copyright":"Aït Benhaddou, Morocco (© Grant Faint/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Ait+BenHaddou+Morocco&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240524_1830%22","title":"Guardians of the dunes","caption":"Aït Benhaddou, Morocco","copyrightonly":"© Grant Faint/Getty Images","desc":"Are you looking for sandy charms?

Clustered within a defensive wall with a gate and corner towers, ksars are a great representation of classic pre-Saharan dwelling.
