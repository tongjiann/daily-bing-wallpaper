Visitors engage with centuries-old tales of power and defense with each step they take inside the fort. Near Poggio San Rocco and Poggio Croce hills lies a necropolis—a large, ancient burial site—with well-preserved Etruscan tombs that hint at the area's long history. The Etruscan civilization inhabited this area and flourished in what is now Tuscany and Umbria between the 8th and 3rd centuries BCE.","date":"Oct 6, 2024","bsTitle":"The stone town of Tuscany","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241006_SoranoItaly%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"03936861b1e494da5ddecf0c64a8d905","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SoranoItaly_EN-US2208208147_tmb.jpg","title":"Ancient town of Sorano, Tuscany, Italy","desc":"Sorano is a serene medieval village perched atop a cliff in the Italian province of Grosseto, southern Tuscany.
