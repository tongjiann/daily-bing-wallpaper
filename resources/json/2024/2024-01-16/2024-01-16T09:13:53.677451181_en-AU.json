Over the years, the site has undergone significant transformations due to environmental changes and temperature fluctuation. Despite the threat of global warming, scientists remain optimistic about this landscape's preservation. The reason? Avalanches that descend from the Alps each winter provide new sources of snow and ice that should keep the cave sustained for years to come.","date":"15 Jan 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240115_IceChapel%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c3e6c974dac1f0b1c9c4360709b24476","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.IceChapel_ROW4612088880_tmb.jpg","title":"The Eiskapelle, Bavaria, Germany","desc":"The Eiskapelle, or Ice Chapel, is a natural cave tucked in the impressive Bavarian Alps around the Königssee—a lake located in southeastern…","hash":"7PekjZPt0Yyo/yY8KODmVbSgEa2Uu2bda5+KNdJncVA="}},{"startdate":"20240114","fullstartdate":"202401140800","enddate":"20240115","url":"/th?id=OHR.HokkaidoSwans_ROW4379782842_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.HokkaidoSwans_ROW4379782842","copyright":"Whooper swans in Lake Kussharo, Japan (© Darrell Gulin/DanitaDelimont.com)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Whooper+swans&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240114_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Whooper swans","copyrightonly":"© Darrell Gulin/DanitaDelimont.com","desc":"An elegant creature for a majestic setting.

Eurasian lynxes are primarily active at night, dawn and dusk, but can hunt during the day when they need to. These solitary hunters are renowned for their keen senses and remarkable agility. In temperate forests, where they play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance by keeping prey species numbers in check, their primary food includes rabbits, hares, marmots and other small mammals.","date":"11 Jan 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240111_LynxSnow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"56b7d887e8b8874ff9ef6c10baad9c26","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LynxSnow_ROW2815737561_tmb.jpg","title":"Eurasian lynx","desc":"Ready for a next-level staring contest?
