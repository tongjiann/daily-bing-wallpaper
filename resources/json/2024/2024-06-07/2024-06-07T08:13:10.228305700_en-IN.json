These flowers also play crucial roles in the valley's ecosystem. Lupines are nitrogen-fixing plants; they help improve soil fertility by converting atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be used by neighbouring plants. Balsamroot, on the other hand, attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies, which helps in plant reproduction and, in turn, contributes to the biodiversity of the region.
