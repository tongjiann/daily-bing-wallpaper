The oceans also produce almost half of the oxygen on our planet thanks to the photosynthesis of plankton—tiny plants, algae and bacteria. Moreover, they absorb a significant amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping mitigate the impacts of climate change caused by human activities.","date":"Jun 7, 2024","bsTitle":"Waves of hope","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240606_HumpbackFamily%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6dc3cc4bf19d99c75cfefa1992706e51","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HumpbackFamily_EN-IN7046950046_tmb.jpg","title":"World Oceans Day","desc":"Today, let's embark on a watery adventure as we celebrate World Oceans Day.
