Leis are garlands crafted from flowers, leaves, and even shells, carrying significant cultural importance in Hawaiian culture. Leis were brought by the Polynesians as they migrated eastward through the Pacific Islands before reaching Hawaii between 1000 and 1200 CE. They represent love, respect, and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Lei Day is an all-day fiesta that includes parades, pageants, lei-making contests, hula dances, and feasts. It also marks the beginning of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.","date":"May 1, 2024","bsTitle":"'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii Nei'","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240501_HawaiianLei%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6f7ccfc486cb720ee51181d3e1d0daa4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HawaiianLei_EN-US6290126556_tmb.jpg","title":"Lei Day","desc":"As the first day of May dawns in Hawaii, Lei Day bursts forth in a riot of color, fragrance, and festivity.

Birds come in a wide range of sizes, colors, and behaviors, making them one of the most diverse groups of animals on Earth—from imposing eagles to today's tiny snowy-winged star, a leucistic Anna's hummingbird in the Australian Garden at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum. These hummingbirds are typically vibrant in color, but leucism means some have decreased pigmentation, resulting in a paler appearance. Unlike albino birds, these hummingbirds do not have red or pink eyes. Their lighter plumage reduces protective camouflage, making them more vulnerable to predators such as hawks and feral cats.","date":"Apr 27, 2024","bsTitle":"Stop!
