Also called World Heritage Day, the event aims to highlight how important the task of conserving our cultural heritage is. A monument can be anything from an architectural work to a sculpture—something that has outstanding value from a historical, artistic or scientific point of view. Some of the amazing heritage sites around the world include Machu Picchu in Peru and the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt. The stone structure in today's image is part of the mediaeval city walls of Ávila in Spain. Built between the 11th and 14th centuries, these fortifications have a perimeter of over 2,438 metres. When they were first built, they served to defend the city against attacks from outsiders; nowadays, visitors can walk around nearly half of the circumference of the walls, enjoying views of the city and the surrounding countryside.","date":"Apr 18, 2024","bsTitle":"Wall of fame","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240417_AvilaSpain%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"236104be2af79252bee1cebbfa7aee2c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AvilaSpain_EN-IN0356835550_tmb.jpg","title":"International Day for Monuments and Sites","desc":"Today is a monumental occasion: International Day for Monuments and Sites.

Bowling Ball Beach on the Mendocino Coast in California is named after the striking rock formations strewn across the shore. These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils. The answer, however, is quite simple: it is the forces of nature at play.","date":"Apr 14, 2024","bsTitle":"Rock 'n' bowl","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240413_BowlingBallCali%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"85d84474c8e79ebf49ee9714e7530b94","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BowlingBallCali_EN-IN9555671935_tmb.jpg","title":"Bowling Ball Beach, California, USA","desc":"Welcome to nature's bowling alley.
