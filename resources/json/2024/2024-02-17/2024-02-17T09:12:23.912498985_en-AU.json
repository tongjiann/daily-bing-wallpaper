Giant anteaters are adapted to living in a variety of habitats. Although these mammals spend most of the time on the ground, they can climb trees. With powerful, curved claws and a tongue that can reach up to 60 centimetres, giant anteaters specialise in feeding on ants and termites, using their acute sense of smell to find their meal. Anteaters play a role as pest controllers and seed dispersers, so their survival—and the survival of many species—is crucial to keep ecosystems balanced.","date":"10 Feb 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240210_GiantAnteaterBR%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a5b331052e9e3b574376f550caef3cf3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GiantAnteaterBR_ROW3873647226_tmb.jpg","title":"Giant anteater","desc":"Behold the giant anteater, whose shaggy-haired appearance is a familiar sight in the Pantanal of Mato Grosso, Brazil.
