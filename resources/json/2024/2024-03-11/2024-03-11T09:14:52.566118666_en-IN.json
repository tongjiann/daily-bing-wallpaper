The conical Arenal Volcano rises to an impressive height of 1,657 metres, standing tall above the surrounding rainforest and Lake Arenal, the largest lake in the country. The sleepy mountain roared to life in a massive 1968 eruption that threw rocks for close to a kilometre. The last significant volcanic activity there took place in 2010, and the once lava-lit peak is currently dormant. With over 500 species of birds, Arenal Volcano National Park is a must-visit location for birdwatchers. The park is also home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including red brocket deer, pumas, white-faced monkeys, orchids, heliconias and ferns. Arenal makes for an imposing and beautiful sight, towering over the tropical trees.","date":"Mar 4, 2024","bsTitle":"A sleeping beauty","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240303_ArenalCostaRica%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"bf4d395a970a5ad5a1f78314b668e544","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArenalCostaRica_EN-IN6333017933_tmb.jpg","title":"Arenal Volcano, Costa Rica","desc":"Greetings from tropical Costa Rica!

The mighty Ganges is said to have originated in Lord Shiva's hair and grown into the revered river that flows through Varanasi today. Along with Sarnath, the city has stood as a venerable centre of education and civilisation for over three millennia. Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya founded the largest university in Asia, the Banaras Hindu University in this city, and the Theosophical Society, led by Annie Besant, also operated in Varanasi.

No, not like this Eurasian red squirrel; rather, that's the term for anyone born on leap day! A leap year is a calendar oddity that exists because Earth's orbit and our usual year count are slightly out of sync. Earth takes 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds, to revolve around the sun. To compensate for those extra 5 hours, February gets an extra day—leap day—every four years. The concept, dating back to the ancient Romans, was refined in the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. While the purpose of the day is to keep our year aligned with the solar calendar, it can also serve as an extra day to prepare for spring! Cultures worldwide mark leap days and years with unique customs. In Ireland and Britain, women propose to men, in Greece, marrying during a leap year is said to bring misfortune, and in France, a satirical newspaper is published.","date":"Feb 29, 2024","bsTitle":"Leaping through an extra day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240228_LeapingSquirrel%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"bf039dc694ae5a6e04fac3a8f8912cd4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LeapingSquirrel_EN-IN2638979538_tmb.jpg","title":"Leap Day","desc":"Are you a 'leapling?'
