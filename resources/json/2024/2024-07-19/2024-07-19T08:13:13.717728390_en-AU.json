Most of the island of Lanzarote has treeless terrain covered with black-grey soil. A series of volcanic eruptions in the past, as recently as the 1700s, led to the unique colouration, and by 1775, farmers started growing crops in the new layer of nutrient-rich soil. This soil absorbs water and retains moisture for a longer period, and the ash keeps the temperature of the soil favourable for the growing grapes. The rows of holes surrounded by stones you see in our image were dug to protect young plants. Today, La Geria stands as a testament to innovation, where traditional cultivation counters arid conditions. A wine connoisseur would be privileged to taste the story of this island through sips of La Geria's fine wine, fermented from Malvasia grapes.","date":"14 Jul 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240714_LaGeriaLanzarote%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7e3544b6ecd2aaf2d45d0ff3c3dce619","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LaGeriaLanzarote_ROW1086932756_tmb.jpg","title":"La Geria wine region, Lanzarote, Canary Islands, Spain","desc":"Surrounded by rugged, dark-hued landscapes, La Geria wine region stands as a viticultural marvel.
