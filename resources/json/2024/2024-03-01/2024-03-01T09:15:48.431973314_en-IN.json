Located about 120 kilometres downstream from Prayagraj, at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, it is a major pilgrimage site for Hindu spirituality and tradition. The mighty Ganges is said to have originated in Lord Shiva's hair and grown into the revered river that flows through Varanasi today. Along with Sarnath, the city has stood as a venerable centre of education and civilisation for over three millennia. Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya founded the largest university in Asia, the Banaras Hindu University in this city, and the Theosophical Society, led by Annie Besant, also operated in Varanasi. Rightly referred to as the cultural capital of India, Varanasi continues to be a thriving platform for the flourishing of various artistic endeavours, including music, dance and philosophy.","date":"Mar 1, 2024","bsTitle":"Riverside reverie","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240229_HolyVaranasi%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3c2e60ede75b6296443901b295dbb073","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HolyVaranasi_EN-IN2569299872_tmb.jpg","title":"The holy city of Varanasi","desc":"Known for its sacred ghats and bustling alleys, Varanasi is a city on the banks of the Ganges in the northern part of India.

No, not like this Eurasian red squirrel; rather, that's the term for anyone born on leap day! A leap year is a calendar oddity that exists because Earth's orbit and our usual year count are slightly out of sync. Earth takes 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds, to revolve around the sun. To compensate for those extra 5 hours, February gets an extra day—leap day—every four years. The concept, dating back to the ancient Romans, was refined in the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. While the purpose of the day is to keep our year aligned with the solar calendar, it can also serve as an extra day to prepare for spring! Cultures worldwide mark leap days and years with unique customs. In Ireland and Britain, women propose to men, in Greece, marrying during a leap year is said to bring misfortune, and in France, a satirical newspaper is published.","date":"Feb 29, 2024","bsTitle":"Leaping through an extra day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240228_LeapingSquirrel%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"bf039dc694ae5a6e04fac3a8f8912cd4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LeapingSquirrel_EN-IN2638979538_tmb.jpg","title":"Leap Day","desc":"Are you a 'leapling?'
