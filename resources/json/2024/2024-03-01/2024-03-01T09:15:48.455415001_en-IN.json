Worn out and damaged during the post-World War I depression, the beach huts received collective maintenance in 1934. Despite the upkeep, the multicoloured structures were faced with the threat of removal in 1952.

For a couple of weeks in February, if skies are clear, water is flowing and the sun shines at just the right angle, the long, slender waterfall takes on a glowing, flame-hued appearance. This phenomenon has earned the moniker 'firefall,' an homage to the historic Yosemite Firefall, a manmade event that was organised in the park from 1872 to 1968.
