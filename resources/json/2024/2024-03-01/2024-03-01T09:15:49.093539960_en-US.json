The seemingly impossible can be found at this time of year on the eastern side of El Capitan, Yosemite National Park's famous rock face. Horsetail Fall is a seasonal waterfall that flows only when there has been plenty of snowfall, and when temperatures have been warm enough to melt it. For a couple of weeks in February, if skies are clear, water is flowing, and the sun shines at just the right angle, the long, slender waterfall takes on a glowing, flame-hued appearance. Hundreds gather in Yosemite Valley to see this mesmerizing natural spectacle. The phenomenon has earned the moniker 'firefall,' an homage to the historic Yosemite Firefall, a manmade event from the top of the park's Glacier Point that took place between 1872 to 1968. Eventually, park rangers decided that dumping embers over a cliff onto the land below wasn't the brightest idea.","date":"Feb 21, 2024","bsTitle":"The flaming falls of Yosemite","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240221_YosemiteFirefall%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8032f53fbe75360c136890998e23289b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YosemiteFirefall_EN-US8169903146_tmb.jpg","title":"Yosemite National Park, California","desc":"Fancy witnessing a fiery waterfall?

At around 2,087 feet, Kinder Scout is the park's highest point and its rugged moorlands and windswept plateaus have drawn walkers and nature enthusiasts for generations. In 1932, it was the stage for a 'mass trespass,' in which hundreds of people on foot protested for public access to these lands. At the time, many areas of open countryside were closed to the British public. This act of civil disobedience prompted much public sympathy, which eventually led to the establishment of the UK's first national parks. The Peak District National Park was the first, designated in April 1951, ensuring that these hills and valleys would be preserved for future generations to enjoy.","date":"Feb 20, 2024","bsTitle":"A park for the people","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240220_PeakDistrictNP%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"feed7a5c2b017d32f22248b9b80ff391","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PeakDistrictNP_EN-US8094447567_tmb.jpg","title":"Kinder Scout, Peak District National Park, England","desc":"Within the vast expanse of England's Peak District National Park lies Kinder Scout Nature Reserve, the site of an historic people's protest…","hash":"Igf2pfqGffFklq2RObg5Ry8zwCDh3pqzjOSVuU+WeQo="}},{"startdate":"20240219","fullstartdate":"202402190800","enddate":"20240220","url":"/th?id=OHR.LincolnSunset_EN-US8001542624_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.LincolnSunset_EN-US8001542624","copyright":"Lincoln Memorial, Washington, DC (© Steve Whiston/Fallen Log Photography/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Presidents+Day&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220240219_0800%22","title":"A tribute at twilight","caption":"Presidents Day","copyrightonly":"© Steve Whiston/Fallen Log Photography/Getty Images","desc":"The United States of America has had 46 commanders in chief, and today, the third Monday of February, we commemorate their legacies.
