The arch, often referred to as 'The Gate of Time', gets illuminated by the light of the setting sun, creating an ambiance that transports us back to the bygone days. It's no wonder that this remarkable arch has become a spot for tourists to visit and capture in photographs.

Lake Magadi is one of the soda lakes that are brimming with cyanobacteria and algae, providing ample nourishment for the flamingos. The spectacle of thousands of these avian wonders congregating at the lake reveals the importance of these unique ecosystems.","date":"13 Mar 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240313_MagadiFlamingos%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b109b5feab7a0d2fa94f57c56493502e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MagadiFlamingos_ROW4848270584_tmb.jpg","title":"Lesser flamingos, Lake Magadi, Kenya","desc":"This aerial photograph shows a flamboyance of lesser flamingos against the backdrop of Lake Magadi in Kenya.

These adorable Australian marsupials can sleep up to 20 hours a day, which helps them conserve the little energy they get from their eucalyptus-based diet. Koalas move slowly when awake, spend most of their time tucked into nooks in trees, and have a lower body temperature than other animals of their size. Koalas are herbivores and their diet consists exclusively of eucalyptus leaves. These leaves are very fibrous and difficult to digest, but koalas have a specialised digestive system that allows them to break down the tough cellulose in the leaves.","date":"11 Mar 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240311_SleepyKoala%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e925e7c3878c78360ad2cf723b34a1d9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SleepyKoala_ROW4497881755_tmb.jpg","title":"Koala sleeping in a eucalyptus tree","desc":"Take a cue from today's image; this sleepy koala may inspire you to catch some Z's.
