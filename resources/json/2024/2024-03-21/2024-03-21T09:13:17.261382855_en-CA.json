In mathematics, however, there are many constants, and today, we're celebrating perhaps the most famous of them all: pi. This tasty-sounding constant is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately 3.14159. Every March 14, mathematics fans across the world get baking to mark Pi Day—a celebration of both the mathematical constant π and its delicious homophone, pie. It began in 1988, when physicist Larry Shaw connected the date (3/14) with the first three digits of this constant. Today, mathematicians and enthusiasts celebrate Pi Day with pie eating and pi reciting. Did you know that when your clock strikes 1:59 today, you will be three decimal places closer to the real value of pi? Pi is everywhere, even in nature. Pictured here is a bodhi tree in the shape of the pi symbol at Wat Phra Ngam, a temple in Ayutthaya, Thailand. Whether you're a math geek or just in it for the treats, Pi Day is for everyone to enjoy!","date":"Mar. 14, 2024","bsTitle":"A piece of pi","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240314_AyutthayaTree%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7d58c33c66430423cf895d55bc14d5a4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AyutthayaTree_EN-CA7341157054_tmb.jpg","title":"Happy Pi Day!","desc":"They say the only constant in life is change.

Lake Magadi is one of the soda lakes that are brimming with cyanobacteria and algae, providing ample nourishment for the flamingos.
