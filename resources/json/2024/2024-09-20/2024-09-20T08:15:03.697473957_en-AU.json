As mammals, dolphins don't have gills so they can't breathe underwater. They must surface to inhale and exhale stale air, which they do through blowholes and not their mouths. How long they can hold their breath depends on the species; some can go for 3 to 7 minutes, while others can stay submerged for up to 20 minutes. Because they must always surface, half of dolphins' brains are always active, meaning they never completely fall asleep. Despite being able to exist in an array of environments and water temperatures, dolphins are threatened by a variety of human activities, such as hunting, pollution and fishing.","date":"12 Sep 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240912_DolphinReunion%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2f347cc2e03e6beab8d4a8cbfe5c31de","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DolphinReunion_ROW4153666724_tmb.jpg","title":"Dolphin pod near Réunion island","desc":"Dolphins are highly intelligent and can be found all over the world in oceans, rivers and estuaries.

It is earthquake-resistant, designed to absorb shifting during a quake. Since its deck is not fixed to the pylons, it can move both lengthwise and sideways.

This historic structure is catalogued in the Base Mérimée, an architectural heritage database managed by the French Ministry of Culture. The original appearance of the cloister is now hard to envision due to extensive restorations carried out between 1900 and 1920. Originally, the cloister had two levels: the lower level, constructed in the early 11th century, featured vaulted galleries with semicircular arches and was free of ornamentation.

Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backwards. Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects.","date":"7 Sep 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240907_SantaCruzHummer%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"61b7f2dc47b461885b39c345f5ab59df","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SantaCruzHummer_ROW3345595068_tmb.jpg","title":"Anna's hummingbird","desc":"Let's meet Anna's hummingbird, seen in today's image.
