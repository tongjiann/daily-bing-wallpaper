Today's homepage image takes us to a spot in the City that Never Sleeps—Union Square in lower Manhattan, New York, USA. At this historic intersection, you can find statues of George Washington—the oldest statue in any park in NYC—and Abraham Lincoln, crafted by the sculptor Henry Kirke Brown. In 1882, workers exercised their rights to free speech and assembly, organising the first Labour Day parade in Union Square. In 1997, United States Department of the Interior recognised this park as a National Historic Landmark due to its importance in US labour history. These days, you're more likely to see street chess players, musicians, skateboarders, dance crews and vendors of all types in the square.","date":"16 Apr 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240416_UnionSquareNYC%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"97f7919ab989a10d2f91942434e54122","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.UnionSquareNYC_ROW6729489728_tmb.jpg","title":"Union Square, Manhattan, New York, USA","desc":"'These streets will make you feel brand new, big lights will inspire you.'

The castle was designed by Domenico da Cortona, constructed for King Francis I, and carries the marks of Leonardo da Vinci, who accompanied the king from Italy to France. The chateau's construction began in 1519. The castle showcases a centralised layout and a double helix staircase, which were inspired by da Vinci. The keep, the true heart of the building, reveals striking architecture, mixing medieval grandeur with Renaissance innovations. The building work was completed in the 17th century, under the reign of Louis XIV. Today, we can stroll through the English gardens, which offer adaptable pathways and a variety of plant selections, including conifers. With over 80 different species planted, the garden is designed to enrich the landscape and harmonise with the existing plantations.","date":"15 Apr 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240415_ChambordCastle%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ecae0bbde373b277813f58281df38b57","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ChambordCastle_ROW6581384117_tmb.jpg","title":"Château de Chambord, France","desc":"Let's admire the Château de Chambord, a pearl of the French Renaissance on the eastern part of the Loire River.

Bowling Ball Beach on the Mendocino Coast in California, USA, is named after the striking rock formations strewn across the shore. These sandstone balls—a phenomenon known as concretions—formed over millions of years as sedimentary layers built up around a central core of sand and stone held together by mineral cements. Erosion gradually wore away the outer layers to expose the spherical shapes we see today. This created a fascinating spectacle that only appears at low tide. Concretions are rare, and there has been plenty of wild speculation about where they come from, with some believing them to be extraterrestrial debris while others wondering if they are dinosaur fossils. The answer, however, is quite simple: it is the forces of nature at play.","date":"14 Apr 2024","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240414_BowlingBallCali%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3bfde20f4c2d09b34febac52f00fdf85","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BowlingBallCali_ROW9309619524_tmb.jpg","title":"Bowling Ball Beach, California, USA","desc":"Welcome to nature's bowling alley.

Venezuela is home to some of the world's most impressive natural wonders, including the highest waterfall on Earth, Angel Falls, found some 6 kilometres south of Churún Marú.

Their name comes from their ability to inhabit burrows dug by mammals like prairie dogs, skunks or armadillos, where they nest and roost. They often look out for each other, warning one another of predators. They lay three to five eggs per clutch, incubating them for about a month.
