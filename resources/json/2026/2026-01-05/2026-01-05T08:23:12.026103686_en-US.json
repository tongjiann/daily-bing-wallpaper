Signed in 1973, the ESA became one of the world's strongest conservation laws, influencing policies well beyond the United States. It demonstrates that recovery is possible when science and enforcement work together. Its influence on conservation is especially clear in species whose futures hinge on international attention. The black-and-white ruffed lemur of Madagascar is one such example. Many people recognize lemurs from the animated movie 'Madagascar,' but the real animal faces a much harsher reality. This striking primate is critically endangered, surviving in increasingly fragmented forests where habitat loss remains a constant threat.","date":"Dec 28, 2025","bsTitle":"What remains wild","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251228_RuffedLemur%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"858632a722462735f072ade884d5da17","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RuffedLemur_EN-US6014028083_tmb.jpg","title":"Anniversary of the Endangered Species Act of 1973","desc":"Fifty-one years after the Endangered Species Act (ESA) became law, its purpose remains clear: to protect species facing extinction and…","hash":"rfgXpxK5ghnAye5MLHYR5A2x+z7Ll19kA/ztCUecFtk="}},{"startdate":"20251227","fullstartdate":"202512270800","enddate":"20251228","url":"/th?id=OHR.SuperiorIceMN_EN-US5952266924_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.SuperiorIceMN_EN-US5952266924","copyright":"Plate ice along Lake Superior, Grand Marais, Minnesota (© wanderluster/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Lake+Superior+Minnesota&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251227_0800%22","title":"Shards of winter","caption":"Plate ice along Lake Superior, Grand Marais, Minnesota","copyrightonly":"© wanderluster/Getty Images","desc":"When winter tightens its grip on Lake Superior in Minnesota, the shoreline transforms into a landscape of tilted, glass-like shards known as plate ice.

Their hooves shrink in winter to expose a gripping rim, then expand in warmer months for better traction. Still not impressed? Consider this: reindeer don't have an internal clock. Instead, their melatonin—the hormone that regulates sleep—adjusts to light and darkness, helping them stay awake through endless nights of gift delivery.","date":"Dec 23, 2025","bsTitle":"Where holiday magic runs on hooves","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251223_ReindeerFinland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d78f1613817651343c636753dc768e9b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ReindeerFinland_EN-US5636971050_tmb.jpg","title":"Reindeer, Lapland, Finland","desc":"Few creatures evoke the magic of the holidays quite like the reindeer.
