This bridge uses the box-girder design, making it a practical choice for crossing the wide, fast-moving Mekong River.","date":"Feb. 13, 2026","bsTitle":"Built to bring closer","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260213_FriendshipBridge%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3de8687f52409ed6a2145357308ab9fe","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FriendshipBridge_EN-CA9180302051_tmb.jpg","title":"Third Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge connecting Laos and Thailand","desc":"Before bridges, rivers set the pace of travel.
