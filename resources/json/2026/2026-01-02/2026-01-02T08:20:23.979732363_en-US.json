No big countdown. No dramatic unwrapping. No last-minute dashes for batteries. It's a rare holiday that says, 'Sit down, finish your leftovers, and take a moment.' Celebrated on December 26 in the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries, it's a national cool-down after Christmas has done all the heavy lifting. The term goes back to Victorian Britain, when households prepared Christmas boxes for workers and tradespeople—tokens of thanks that ranged from coins to essentials. Churches joined in by opening alms boxes and distributing donations.","date":"Dec 26, 2025","bsTitle":"Unboxed traditions","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251226_WiltshireDawn%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"880bdcc06f9c9505349f3c8714048764","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WiltshireDawn_EN-US5663179833_tmb.jpg","title":"Boxing Day","desc":"The best thing about Boxing Day is that it doesn't ask much of you.

Sturdy and sure-footed, they've been pulling Santa's sleigh ever since Clement Clarke Moore cast them in the role in his 1823 poem 'A Visit from Saint Nicholas.' And they were born for it. Their hooves shrink in winter to expose a gripping rim, then expand in warmer months for better traction. Still not impressed? Consider this: reindeer don't have an internal clock. Instead, their melatonin—the hormone that regulates sleep—adjusts to light and darkness, helping them stay awake through endless nights of gift delivery.","date":"Dec 23, 2025","bsTitle":"Where holiday magic runs on hooves","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251223_ReindeerFinland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d78f1613817651343c636753dc768e9b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ReindeerFinland_EN-US5636971050_tmb.jpg","title":"Reindeer, Lapland, Finland","desc":"Few creatures evoke the magic of the holidays quite like the reindeer.

As night falls and the household drifts into sleep, the little girl and her nutcracker embark on a fantastical journey—battling the Mouse King and wandering through the Land of Sweets. Among its most famous moments is the dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy—the ruler of the Land of Sweets—accompanied by music that has become iconic.
