These towering redwoods are the tallest trees on Earth—one here stretches about 258 feet, roughly the height of 43 people stacked head to toe. Most are 600–800 years old, and some have stood for over a millennium, yet they're still considered 'young' for a species that can live for 2,000 years.","date":"Jan 9, 2026","bsTitle":"Where time grows tall","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260109_MuirWoodsMonument%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"61c8bdf6b9390013971f5025d9669f87","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MuirWoodsMonument_EN-US9831416144_tmb.jpg","title":"Muir Woods National Monument anniversary","desc":"Step into the realm of giants.

In Arches National Park, Utah, Turret Arch—seen through North Window—offers a striking reminder: landscapes can take hundreds of millions of years to assemble. The Entrada Sandstone that forms these arches began as shifting dunes and shallow seas long before erosion carved today's shapes. Even so, these formations are relatively young. Most rocks on Earth disappear over time because plate tectonics, erosion, and volcanism continually recycle the crust. Only the planet's ancient continental shields preserve truly old material. Canada's Acasta Gneiss, about 4 billion years old, is the oldest known rock still rooted where it formed.","date":"Jan 7, 2026","bsTitle":"Rock legends","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260107_OldRockArch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f12e6a6d651f4d90794ba1f4c72f8b3a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OldRockArch_EN-US2422589534_tmb.jpg","title":"Old Rock Day","desc":"Today is a day that puts time into perspective.
