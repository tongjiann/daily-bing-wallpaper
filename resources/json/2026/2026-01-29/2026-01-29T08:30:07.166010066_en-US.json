Completed in 1895, this towering Flemish Renaissance Revival masterpiece doesn't just dominate the skyline; it defines it. For nearly eight decades, it stood as the city's tallest building, a title it proudly held until 1973. Designed by architect Henry C. Koch, this hall blends German-inspired architecture with Milwaukee's own historic influences. That connection isn't accidental—its design pays tribute to the city's strong German heritage, which shaped much of the surrounding neighborhood as well.","date":"Jan 29, 2026","bsTitle":"A tall story of Milwaukee","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260129_MilwaukeeHall%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8e310a6dbe6ec521f85480315c8aaf4e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MilwaukeeHall_EN-US9990591477_tmb.jpg","title":"Milwaukee City Hall, Wisconsin","desc":"If you've ever wandered through downtown Milwaukee and looked up in awe, chances are you were staring at the iconic Milwaukee City Hall…","hash":"JB9Oq1hN616CKZAYxcq/wE32xxP1/eXOeurPfOChdEs="}},{"startdate":"20260128","fullstartdate":"202601280800","enddate":"20260129","url":"/th?id=OHR.WhanganuiPark_EN-US9741312204_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.WhanganuiPark_EN-US9741312204","copyright":"Whanganui National Park, Retaruke, New Zealand (© Matthew Micah Wright/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Whanganui+National+Park+New+Zealand&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220260128_0800%22","title":"Flow with it","caption":"Whanganui National Park, Retaruke, New Zealand","copyrightonly":"© Matthew Micah Wright/Getty Images","desc":"Whanganui National Park showcases one of New Zealand's most distinctive river landscapes.
