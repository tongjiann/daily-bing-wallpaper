Lake Tahoe, straddling the border between California and Nevada, United States, fits that bill perfectly. Formed during the Ice Age, the lake was shaped by faulting and glacial carving that created its deep basin. It is now one of the deepest freshwater lakes in the United States. For generations, the Washoe people lived around these clear waters, fishing and gathering seasonally. Centuries later, miners arrived, steamboats crossed the water and Tahoe shifted from a resource hub to a year-round retreat.","date":"3 Feb 2026","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260203_FanetteIsland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7b4804b48177b0de5658d82b113d5891","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FanetteIsland_ROW2696648958_tmb.jpg","title":"Emerald Bay and Fannette Island, Lake Tahoe, California, United States","desc":"You know a place holds stories when geologists, filmmakers and local folklore all claim it for different reasons.

They stand out for their social life and their ability to adapt to the harshest winters. They live in colonies that cooperate with each other and use sharp whistles to warn of predators. Their bodies are robust, and they have thick coats of fur that protect them from extreme cold. During winter, they hibernate for several months thanks to a remarkable drop in body temperature. They dig extensive underground tunnels where they take shelter and raise their young. In today's image, we see alpine marmots in Hohe Tauern National Park in Austria, a landscape where this animal has become a symbol of high mountain life. Observing them in the wild allows us to admire their social behaviour and survival skills, connecting visitors with nature in its most authentic state.","date":"2 Feb 2026","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260202_AlpineMarmots%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c8c18282d26d76f3c9fb6452c09cefd9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AlpineMarmots_ROW2437915597_tmb.jpg","title":"Alpine marmots, Hohe Tauern National Park, Austria","desc":"Alpine marmots are among the most charismatic inhabitants of the central European mountains.
