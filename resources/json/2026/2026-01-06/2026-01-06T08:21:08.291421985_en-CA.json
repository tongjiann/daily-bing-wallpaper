Whooper swans have touched down. One loud whoop—and winter suddenly feels awake. These birds migrate from Siberia and the Russian Far East, choosing Japan as their seasonal home because its lakes offer what long-distance travellers crave: open water, steady food and a safe place to rest. One of their favourite destinations is Kotoku Pond in the Kantō region on Japan's largest island.","date":"Dec. 30, 2025","bsTitle":"Whoop, there they fly","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251230_JapanSwans%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"314091af524fa4aac832e2b4bcc2472c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JapanSwans_EN-CA0491937119_tmb.jpg","title":"Whooper swans, Kotoku Pond, Japan","desc":"In Japan's colder months, there's a morning moment when stillness breaks—not with wind or footsteps, but with a bright, rolling call that…","hash":"Mlee72UzGX3T2lSw2LX5wTKd77UoT0gAgzpWzvtg3Q4="}},{"startdate":"20251229","fullstartdate":"202512290500","enddate":"20251230","url":"/th?id=OHR.AniTurkey_EN-CA0360895261_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.AniTurkey_EN-CA0360895261","copyright":"St. Gregory Church in Ani Ruins, Kars, Türkiye (© Kenan Talas/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Ani+Ruins&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220251229_0500%22","title":"The church that outlived a city","caption":"St. Gregory Church in Ani Ruins, Kars, Türkiye","copyrightonly":"© Kenan Talas/Getty Images","desc":"On a windswept plateau in eastern Türkiye, along the border with Armenia, the ruins of the ancient city of Ani rise from the landscape with striking clarity.

Roughly 92% of the lemur's diet is fruit, with leaves, nectar, seeds and the occasional fungus making up the rest. When trees are heavy with figs and other seasonal offerings, this creature moves quickly through the dense forest. As it laps up nectar, pollen sticks to its snout, turning it into one of the habitat's most effective pollinators.","date":"Dec. 28, 2025","bsTitle":"What remains wild","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251228_RuffedLemur%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0a919ade14416d7ff4ce89509535318e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RuffedLemur_EN-CA4162667065_tmb.jpg","title":"Black-and-white ruffed lemur in Madagascar","desc":"One moment the canopy is still, and the next, a burst of black and white shoots through it like a living exclamation mark.
