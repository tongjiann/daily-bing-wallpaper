The falls cascade 297 metres down a towering cliff, one of Europe's highest free-falling waterfalls, creating a shimmering veil of mist that can be seen for miles around. The town of Lauterbrunnen, with its 72 waterfalls, is often considered one of the most picturesque valleys in the world. This is the landscape a young traveller, J.R.R. Tolkien, crossed during a hiking trip in 1911, long before he became the storyteller behind 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.' Its soaring cliffs, silver waterfalls and crisp mountain air left a lasting impression and are believed to have inspired his vision of Rivendell, the elven refuge hidden deep in Middle-earth.","date":"3 Jan 2026","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260103_LauterbrunnenValley%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7deeb7fd3bc1b6504dea4e009c51fbe5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LauterbrunnenValley_ROW1355118346_tmb.jpg","title":"Staubbach Falls at Lauterbrunnen, Canton of Bern, Switzerland","desc":"Our picture of the day takes us to the Swiss village of Lauterbrunnen, where the Staubbach Falls shimmer in the distance beyond a quiet…","hash":"cJ70sn3DVfi2ifhqSsH4iNXonguCA5Gkv4uV5O0MjhM="}},{"startdate":"20260102","fullstartdate":"202601020800","enddate":"20260103","url":"/th?id=OHR.VeniceView_ROW3935417793_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.VeniceView_ROW3935417793","copyright":"Aerial view of Venice, Italy (© Clement Leonard/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=Venice+Italy&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220260102_0800%22","title":"Info","caption":"Aerial view of Venice, Italy","copyrightonly":"© Clement Leonard/Getty Images","desc":"Seeing Venice from above is mesmerising, but this Italian gem's true magic lies within its walls and waterways.

Originally a wooden crossing, the bridge took on its signature red-brick Gothic revival form in 1896, complete with turreted towers that look like they wandered in from a medieval set. But the real twist came during the Cold War, when the bridge became a strict checkpoint between East and West. After reunification, it was restored in the 1990s and welcomed the U1 line back across its upper deck.","date":"31 Dec 2025","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251231_GermanyNewYear%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"60404b7841cbc51444f71679f69b6476","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GermanyNewYear_ROW1011878383_tmb.jpg","title":"Oberbaum Bridge, Berlin, Germany","desc":"If a bridge could win 'Best Supporting Role' in a city's story, Germany's Oberbaum Bridge in Berlin would sweep the awards.
