At that moment, Martin Luther King, Jr. stepped forward, a Baptist minister and the strategic heart of the civil rights movement. He fought injustice with discipline, clarity, and nonviolent resolve, delivering a vision that reshaped the nation's imagination: a future where freedom was real, dignity was universal, and justice extended to all.","date":"Jan 19, 2026","bsTitle":"Standing where hope rose","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260119_MLKSunrise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"133fcc613413fb08b681796534e7d666","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MLKSunrise_EN-US0641684404_tmb.jpg","title":"Martin Luther King Jr. Day","desc":"In the summer heat of 1963, a quarter of a million people gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC, for one of the largest…","hash":"vqoruXlZHbCOESvMyjjowIEh2G8gZtMPCgu0l2oWttw="}},{"startdate":"20260118","fullstartdate":"202601180800","enddate":"20260119","url":"/th?id=OHR.WhiteSandsNM_EN-US0565482616_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","urlbase":"/th?id=OHR.WhiteSandsNM_EN-US0565482616","copyright":"White Sands National Park, New Mexico (© Francesco Carucci/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=White+Sands+National+Park+New+Mexico&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220260118_0800%22","title":"A desert in disguise","caption":"White Sands National Park, New Mexico","copyrightonly":"© Francesco Carucci/Getty Images","desc":"If 'Frozen' traded ice for sand, the result would look a lot like White Sands National Park in New Mexico—cool, white dunes that deceive the eye at first glance.
