Its layers of shale and sandstone have caused landslips for centuries, including a collapse that permanently closed the A625 road in 1979.","date":"Feb. 22, 2026","bsTitle":"The mother of hills","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260222_MamTorSunrise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ba87d86b616c7b790cc972aac8ea84ad","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MamTorSunrise_EN-CA7950136962_tmb.jpg","title":"Mam Tor, Derbyshire, England","desc":"'Shivering Mountain' is a dramatic nickname, but Mam Tor has earned it over hundreds of years.
