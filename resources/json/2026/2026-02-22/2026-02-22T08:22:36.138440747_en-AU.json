This landmark takes its name from Old English, 'mam' meaning 'mother,' a nod to the smaller hills it appears to cradle. Yet this 'mother mountain' is famously unstable. Its layers of shale and sandstone have caused landslips for centuries, including a collapse that permanently closed the A625 road in 1979.","date":"22 Feb 2026","bsTitle":"Info","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260222_MamTorSunrise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"85c2132b587423746513d4f02cb4d6f0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MamTorSunrise_ROW2203325574_tmb.jpg","title":"Mam Tor, Derbyshire, England","desc":"'Shivering Mountain' is a dramatic nickname, but Mam Tor has earned it over hundreds of years.
