A Burns Night supper blends warmth and wit: the centrepiece is haggis, a savoury pudding made from minced meat, oats and spices, served with neeps (mashed turnips) and tatties (mashed potatoes). Add plenty of good cheer, readings of Burns's verse and a dram of whisky and you have a celebration that ends with a rousing chorus of 'Auld Lang Syne.' Even if you're celebrating stateside, these traditions are easy to adopt—set the table, cue the poetry and let the toasts flow.","date":"Jan 25, 2026","bsTitle":"Tradition burns bright","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260124_BurnsPark%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"af1b248ee58ed404d34039a7ccb37719","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BurnsPark_EN-IN8501702945_tmb.jpg","title":"Burns Night in Scotland","desc":"Each January 25, Scots and friends around the world raise a toast to Robert Burns, Scotland's beloved national poet.
