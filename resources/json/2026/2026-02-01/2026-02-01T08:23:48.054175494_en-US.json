A Burns Night supper blends warmth and wit: the centerpiece is haggis, a savory pudding made from minced meat, oats, and spices, served with neeps (mashed turnips) and tatties (mashed potatoes). Add plenty of good cheer, readings of Burns's verse, and a dram of whisky, and you have a celebration that ends with a rousing chorus of 'Auld Lang Syne.' Even if you're celebrating stateside, these traditions are easy to adopt—set the table, cue the poetry, and let the toasts flow.","date":"Jan 25, 2026","bsTitle":"Tradition burns bright","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260125_BurnsPark%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b1e8b4e049724d8a1856a02f0a0452ef","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[],"og":{"img":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BurnsPark_EN-US9363066918_tmb.jpg","title":"Burns Night in Scotland","desc":"Each January 25, Scots and friends around the world raise a toast to Robert Burns, Scotland's beloved national poet.
